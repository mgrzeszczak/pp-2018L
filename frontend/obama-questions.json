[{"body": "Here is a collection of all the questions and answers:\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mnkw)\n>I am recent law school graduate. Despite graduating from a top school, I find myself unemployed with a large student loan debt burden. While I'm sure my immediate prospects will improve in time, it's difficult to be optimistic about the future knowing that my ability to live a productive life -- to have a fulfilling career, to buy a house, to someday raise a family -- is hampered by my debt and the bleak economic outlook for young people. I know that I'm not alone in feeling this way. Many of us are demoralized. Your 2008 campaign was successful in large part due to the efforts of younger demographics. We worked for you, we campaigned for you, and we turned out in record numbers to vote for you. What can I say to encourage those in similar situations as I am to show up again in November? What hope can you offer us for your second term?\n\nAnswer:\n>I understand how tough it is out there for recent grads. You're right - your long term prospects are great, but that doesn't help in the short term. Obviously some of the steps we have taken already help young people at the start of their careers. Because of the health care bill, you can stay on your parent's plan until you're twenty six. Because of our student loan bill, we are lowering the debt burdens that young people have to carry. But the key for your future, and all our futures, is an economy that is growing and creating solid middle class jobs - and that's why the choice in this election is so important. The other party has two ideas for growth - more taxs cuts for the wealthy (paid for by raising tax burdens on the middle class and gutting investments like education) and getting rid of regulations we've put in place to control the excesses on wall street and help consumers. These ideas have been tried, they didnt work, and will make the economy worse. I want to keep promoting advanced manufacturing that will bring jobs back to America, promote all-American energy sources (including wind and solar), keep investing in education and make college more affordable, rebuild our infrastructure, invest in science, and reduce our deficit in a balanced way with prudent spending cuts and higher taxes on folks making more than $250,000/year. I don't promise that this will solve all our immediate economic challenges, but my plans will lay the foundation for long term growth for your generation, and for generations to follow. So don't be discouraged - we didn't get into this fix overnight, and we won't get out overnight, but we are making progress and with your help will make more.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mom8)\n>What's the recipe for the White House's beer?\n\nAnswer:\n>It will be out soon! I can tell from first hand experience, it is tasty.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mnz9)\n>What are you going to do to end the corrupting influence of money in politics during your second term?\n\nAnswer:\n>Money has always been a factor in politics, but we are seeing something new in the no-holds barred flow of seven and eight figure checks, most undisclosed, into super-PACs; they fundamentally threaten to overwhelm the political process over the long run and drown out the voices of ordinary citizens. We need to start with passing the Disclose Act that is already written and been sponsored in Congress - to at least force disclosure of who is giving to who. We should also pass legislation prohibiting the bundling of campaign contributions from lobbyists. Over the longer term, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United (assuming the Supreme Court doesn't revisit it). Even if the amendment process falls short, it can shine a spotlight of the super-PAC phenomenon and help apply pressure for change.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmg8)\n>What was the most difficult decision that you had to make during this term?\n\nAnswer:\n>The decision to surge our forces in afghanistan. Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you. The decision did help us blunt the taliban's momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014. But knowing of the heroes that have fallen is something you never forget.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm2v)\n>What is the first thing you'll do on November 7th, win or lose?\n\nAnswer:\n>Win or lose, I'll be thanking everybody who is working so hard - especially all the volunteers in field offices all across the country, and the amazing young people in our campaign offices.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60ml11)\n>How are you going help small businesses in 2013 and 2014? and what if any bills are you going to implement for small businesses, in 2013, and 2014?\n\nAnswer:\n>We've really focused on this since I came into office - 18 tax cuts for small business, easier funding from the SBA. Going forward, I want to keep taxes low for the 98 percent of small businesses that have $250,000 or less in income, make it easier for small business to access financing, and expand their opportunities to export. And we will be implementing the Jobs Act bill that I signed that will make it easier for startups to access crowd-funding and reduce their tax burden at the start-up stage.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm5n)\n>Who's your favourite Basketball player?\n\nAnswer:\n>Jordan - I'm a Bulls guy.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mlwx)\n>We know how Republicans feel about protecting Internet Freedom. Is Internet Freedom an issue you'd push to add to the Democratic Party's 2012 platform?\n\nAnswer:\n>Internet freedom is something I know you all care passionately about; I do too. We will fight hard to make sure that the internet remains the open forum for everybody - from those who are expressing an idea to those to want to start a business. And although there will be occasional disagreements on the details of various legislative proposals, I won't stray from that principle - and it will be reflected in the platform.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm41)\n>Are you considering increasing funds to the space program?\n\nAnswer:\n>Making sure we stay at the forefront of space exploration is a big priority for my administration. The passing of Neil Armstrong this week is a reminder of the inspiration and wonder that our space program has provided in the past; the curiosity probe on mars is a reminder of what remains to be discovered. The key is to make sure that we invest in cutting edge research that can take us to the next level - so even as we continue work with the international space station, we are focused on a potential mission to a asteroid as a prelude to a manned Mars flight.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmaf)\n>How do you balance family life and hobbies with, well, being the POTUS?\n\nAnswer:\n>It's hard - truthfully the main thing other than work is just making sure that I'm spending enough time with michelle and the girls. The big advantage I have is that I live above the store - so I have no commute! So we make sure that when I'm in DC I never miss dinner with them at 6:30 pm - even if I have to go back down to the Oval for work later in the evening. I do work out every morning as well, and try to get a basketball or golf game in on the weekends just to get out of the bubble. Speaking of balance, though, I need to get going so I'm back in DC in time for dinner. But I want to thank everybody at reddit for participating - this is an example of how technology and the internet can empower the sorts of conversations that strengthen our democracy over the long run.

However, there are some things that I'd like to tell you and get your take on them.  Firstly, my unit hasn't had anything in the way of up to date gear since I joined the army.  Most of our vehicles are leaking one fluid or another, we have no mounts for any of our crew served weapons and, the few occasions I have had load bearing gear, it looked like it had just got off a flight from Quang Tri province.  On top of this, my unit has been laden with what I would characterize as \"toxic leadership.\"  NCOs who made their E-5 and saw to it that none of the junior enlisted did the same.  They fudged PT tests and terrorized their junior enlisted, simply because they could.  I believe in our military and in our fighting men but conditions in the rear are drastically, and negatively, impacting mission readiness.  How can we be expected to go on active duty and run with the big dogs of regular army when everything we have done as reservists borders on a joke?  It would be my great hope that in your second term (and I never thought I'd say this, especially as a republican, but I'm hoping there is a second term for you) that you would take steps to modernize our reserve and national guard.  That you would free up funds to get us the equipment that we desperately need to \"train as we fight.\"  That you would implement regulations that thoroughly evaluate soldiers, not just when they became NCOs, but as they remain NCOs to ensure that good leaders are rewarded for their service, and toxic ones are punished, just the same as junior enlisted are.  I really see the reserves as a modern and powerful fighting force, but we could be so much more if we could do more practical and flexible training, AT's to do more than just train but actually do our jobs, etc.  Thanks for your time sir.

There, you told the students that you would make it easier to get Pell Grants, and that more federal aid would be available should you get reelected.  You also stated how Mr. Romney was trying to cut aid to students.  My question is this: Why would I want more federal money?  I don't want the federal loans I have now, but the system as it stands nearly forces me to have them if I want to be able to attend college.\n\nI don't want grants and scholarships to be more easily available, I want regulation on the schools.  It's a terrible, vicious cycle that is, to be blunt, screwing the students.  The schools get together and ask themselves \"How much can we squeeze out of the students this year?\"  They come up with a number, and the banks and private institutions go \"Well crap, now the students will need more money.  I guess we'll just have to make bigger loans\".  Then the Federal Government comes in and adds MORE money to the mix, allowing the schools to charge even more.  It's a cycle with no end in sight without somebody stepping in and doing something about it.\n\nThere has been plenty of talk on Capital Hill about \"for profit\" schools; The University of Pheonix, DeVry University, to name a few.  You want to know who the real \"for profit\" schools are?  Harvard, Yale, MIT, Ohio State.  The schools who charge upwards of $20,000 per quarter for no other reason than that they can.  They know that the students and their parents can't afford it, but they don't care because they know that between private loans and the Federal Aid program, they'll get the money they want.  I just got out of Wright State University, and with only the help of a private loan and Federal Loans to get me through due to my family having little to no money, after two years, I'm already sitting at over $35,000 in debt, and that's just to private loans.  $35,000 in two years.  I'm not even 21 yet for God's sake!  I can't even drink the pain away of knowing that at 20, I already have a MOUNTAIN of debt, and more to come if I want a degree that can help me land a job.  \n\nSo my question to you is this: if you really want my vote, if you really care as much about the students as you say you do, why do you keep letting the schools run rampant and why do you feel the need to leave us in the dust with a mountain of debt so early in our lives?", "author": "TheLegNBass"}, {"body": "So five minutes ago I saw this post had like 9300 points.

The educational system in the United States seems to be in decline - not just on an economic level, but in content and in graduation rates across the country. 50% of Ph.D recipients in the United States are foreign born (in some cases and schools, 100% of them), which, for the number of American college students, is an abysmal ratio.\n\nFrom the republican party, the only thing we hear regarding education in the U.S. is \"an end to tenure and teacher's unions\" as a solution to a problem that is only partly addressed by attempting to introduce competition into the teaching occupation, and does little to address the woeful standards of teaching, with no clear economic plan to support this.\n\nThat and their support of Creationism and religious freedom in schools has me incredibly worried.\n\nWhat will be your platform regarding education in the U.S. - both contentious and economic, for your next term?\n\nCheers, and thanks for being so open about this.

As someone lives in the metro Detroit area and works in Detroit I'm sure you've heard all the stories of the out-of-control crime rate in the city from the media (which is often much worse than it seems on the news) and many people who often come to Detroit or live here are purchasing guns in larger numbers as of recently (myself included) to protect themselves no thanks to an understaffed, underfunded, and underpaid police force.

And I know you will not see this, but I am writing it anyways.\n\nI hope to god that you win the election. I go to a school that is very narrow minded and is about 95% Republican, (and I am low balling it) and I am one of the only democrats. But of course when I voice my opinions I get things such as \" you aren't american, your opinion doesn't count\", \"go back to Europe!\", \"no one cares what you think, you aren't even american\". I still fight on and voice my opinions. It also helps that a young man my age is on my side. And he is destined to be president. Its amazing. He is so good at debating and speeches. I swear put him in front of a room full of republicans for 10 minutes and you'd have over half of them agreeing with him and having Democratic views on things by the end of it! Which gives me hope in my school.\n\nI also want to tell you that I applaud everything you do. I am so happy you are the president. People seem to blame you for the economy and say america has gone down hill. But I can see the amazing changes you have done. I can see the way you have helped the people. They should be grateful to have such an amazing president. I think sometimes they just disagree and cause problems, just for the sake of it. I do not understand why they are so against \"Obama-care\" , do they not understand. This is the UNITED states of america. The people should be united. They shouldn't want to continue with the health care the way it is. Having hundreds die because they cannot afford an operation or medication. That is insane. They seem to find these things out and just say \"Oh how sad!\" or \"Oh that poor man/woman\". Yet they do not want something to help them? I cannot find the logic in it. They seem to think that their money will be paying for everyone. But don't they get that it works both ways? If they need the help, they will get it. If they had a family member or friend who needed help, it would help save their lives? It makes no sense to me. I know that I am 15, and people may mock me all they want, but I am not an idiot. I understand. I have my own opinions. I also am shocked they do not seem to care about all the jobs you have created. Yes unemployment is still bad, but it IS getting better. They seem to be all pissy because you didn't come into office and BAM instantly make the economy fantastic. It wasn't just Bush that caused these problems. Many factors went into it and many presidents who made mistakes. You have been doing everything you could. It isn't your fault bills weren't passed that would of boosted the economy. I really hope you get the second term in office. Because those four more years will give you the time to fix things and do everything you said you would. No body could fix an economy that bad in only four years. And it is going to take years and years to make this economy what the american people want it to be. You are just the begging. Presidents after will also have to deal with this. Democrat or Republican. The same economy is needed to be fixed. Hopefully they will make correct decisions. But for right now, in my opinion, America needs you as their president. And I sure as hell hope they realize that.\nAlso I also love what your wife is doing. No other first lady has cared as much as she does about the health of american youth. I know if she continues Childhood Obesity will decrease dramatically and maybe someday be a thing of the past.\n\nThis has already been extremely long. And you most likely will not see this. But Mr.President, in my opinion (as useless as it may be) is America is lucky to have a man like you as their president. And i hope they see that and elect you again.

Legalize drugs. Prohibition created more crime, this is the same with the current war on drugs. If you\u00b4ve ever been to south america, drugs are very cheap to come by, this is why drugs are funneled into countries like the US because a higher profit margin is expected. In this way, the war on drugs is creating more disparity in the world by funding these drug cartels. No profit, means they cannot sustain their forces, which means that drug cartels will vanish. Have you ever seen a Liquor Cartel? Nope, because liquor is sold freely.\n\n2. Ban private prisons. These prisons are run for profit and in order to keep these profits up, it is in their best interest to lock up the population. This ties in with the legalize drugs issue, since most of the people locked up are for non-violent victimless drug offences. Heck, most people are locked up for just victimless crimes. Prisons should be reserved for people with actual crimes concerning real victims, fines for the rest. Public prisons are enough for these people. The US has a shocking amount of its population in prison, for the land of the free, this is extremely shameful.\n\n3. Cut military spending. This money is better served pumping back into the economy in improving the infrastructure throughout the US. Improving the education, training programs, etc. Who needs an army that can conquer the world, if they have to return to the rubble that was the US.\n\n4. Get rid of the DHS, TSA, and all laws against the constitution. A free nation values privacy most of all. To be free is to be left alone if one wishes to be left alone.

Another talking point has to do with fiscal responsibility and yet debt has exploded under every president since Reagan. The list goes on and on.

I am a CASA volunteer where I work with abused and neglected children who are in the court system by advocating for them in the courts. Many of these children who end up in the foster care system come from backgrounds of poverty and many also receive public assistance.  From my work and exposure to this, many of these people are not lazy or bums.  Many of them are working poor who have jobs.  However, the current system, as it stands, forces these people into having to choose between two bad choices. For example, someone who receives housing assistance is forced to choose between accepting a promotion or raise at work and losing their home because their new salary makes them ineligible to receive their housing assistance.

It's a lot of trouble to go through when you could simply walk to the gas station and buy a back of butts or a thirty rack.\nAlso: Marijuana has never killed someone, nor can you overdose on it.

We've seen what NASA can do with the amazing Curiosity rover, let's continue to fund these incredible missions of exploration!\n\nHowever, there are a few things that I wonder about, which don't seem to be in the spotlight:\n\n* Why are medical services (for example Ambulance transportation) still absurdly expensive? \n\n* Why hasn't the government looked into reducing the cost of space transport? This would allow us to extract resources on the moon, the asteroid belt, and other celestial bodies which contain minerals that are very rare/almost nonexistent on Earth. This economic downturn has shown us that we need to find some other source of income. Why not look to the stars for the solution?!\n\n* The United States' power and transportation infrastructure needs a serious overhaul. In my state (Connecticut), we barely have the funds to repair old/worn out roadways, let alone maintain the new ones and other New England states seem to suffer from the same problem. I've read many articles stating that our power grid is \"duct taped\" together, and if a disaster occurs, we could have a power outage on the scale of the Indian blackout where nearly 600 million people were without power. \n\nCould we not solve our unemployment crisis by putting people to work repairing and updating our power and transportation infrastructure?\n\nThank you for your time Mr. President.

Please thank Mrs. Obama for her advocacy of better nutrition in schools, nutrition education, and community gardening.", "author": "TardisNoises"}, {"body": "I know this is not a popular subject but I hope someone at your office reads this\n\n\nI am a veteran from the 2nd Battalion 503rd Parachute Infantry Regiment(2006-2009). I served our Nation and I was deployed to Afghanistan from May, 2007 - August, 2008. I served with many of our Nation's great Heroes. PFC Juan S. Restrepo (KIA, and name of our unit's recent documentary \"Restrepo\", SSG. Larry I. Rougle (KIA), SGT. Joshua C. Brennan (KIA), Salvatore Augustine Giunta (living recipient of the Medal of Honor), and many, many others. Luckily, I was still able to walk away after receiving the Purple Heart. Yet, if the Lacey Act were in affect during my time in service many of my fellow servicemen, family, and I would have been considered Felons. \n\nI, like many other members of our military need to keep reptiles, and more specifically snakes, if we want to have pets. We need a companion that we won't have to worry about while we are off on a training exercise for a week or so. Snakes are that perfect pet for us. \n\nNow that I am out of the Military, my passion and one of my main sources of income is breeding and selling snakes. My livelihood will be severely crippled by laws like the Lacey Act. \n\nYour own Executive order 13563 states, \"Our regulatory system must protect public health, welfare, safety, and our environment while promoting economic growth, innovation, competitiveness, and job creation. It must be based on the best available science. It must allow for public participation and an open exchange of ideas.\" I applaud that decision, it was monumental. However, please consider the following reasons I feel this order was violated by the recent python ban. \n\n1) Best Available Science: Any major university or scientific organization has a simple standard for a basic paper to become what we refer to as a \"Scientific Paper\". This standard is going through peer review. The USGS survey on Python migration, on which this ban is based does not meet that basic criteria. It did not go through the peer review process, and therefore by any definition does not pass as true science. Without peer review it is merely a written speculation, this document should have sought peer review if it wanted to be considered more than an opinion. I believe this was not done for one of two reasons. First the paper was based on temperatures that could be, but are not currently.[1] This is very weak science, and the temperature estimates are highly questionable. Secondly, the study was done on Indian Pythons, not Burmese Pythons. [2] To study one species, but apply it to another is quite irresponsible. It would be like saying Brown Bears can survive in Utah, so for that reason so could Polar Bears. Indian Pythons and Burmese Pythons are very different animals, and this would have made it very difficult for the USGS study to pass peer review at all. \n\n2) Currently the Burmese python problem is limited to the state of Florida, which already has restrictions in place. Plus, this law does nothing about Burmese Pythons in Florida. People are still allowed to own and breed them, they just can't sell them over state lines. What is going to happen with all the breeders who have gravid/pregnant females before this was introduced and have 40 or more snakes to try and sell? This is doing nothing to prevent anymore Burmese Pythons from getting released in the everglades, or anywhere else. In fact, this may cause more to be released. To make this state issue into a federal violation will cost us thousands of jobs, and solve zero problems. \n\n3) If the issue is the environment, this was a bad move. Many people have already said online that if they move they will need to leave their snakes behind. If they take their snakes to a veterinarian over state lines they will be forced to break the law. According to the American Veterinarians Association there are over 2 million Pythons in captivity. When American's would like to move between states,what happens to the snakes? Like I stated before, what about our Military's Servicemen and women? Many of them keep snakes as pets. Snakes are able to be left locked up while their owners are out training, etc... What if they PCS (Permanent Change of Station) to a unit in another state? what are they suppose to do? There are very few snake rescues, and it would be irresponsible to give a snake away to a family not properly ready to care for it. I predict many snakes will be let go, in order for families to stay in compliance with the new law. The Burmese Python Initiative is the Nation's first Python rescue that I am aware of. It is in Florida. The other 49 states have no viable option when moving. Again, this is only going to cause good citizens to become law breakers or further python releases. \n\nDamaging a $103,000,000.00 industry during an economic crisis is a terrible cost for a law that by any sensible means will only make the problem worse[3]. I dearly hope this ban does not cause nation wide releases, but I fear it will. ALL snake breeding businesses are small businesses. Even the largest are only 20 employees strong. This means the over one hundred million dollar figure will put a larger than normal number of small business owners out of business. \n\nIf your administration's real goal is helping small businesses this is the wrong move. If the administration's real goal is to help the environment this is the wrong move. I for one do not see how this furthers either cause. If there is something I am missing please inform me of what it is. I really do not see any positive in this monumental decision. \n\nThank you so much for your time.

Would you consider, in a 2nd term, pushing to remove the SS cap, and perhaps adding a SS tax onto investment income, even if it meant maybe reducing the cap gains rate?

My thought process on that, if the 401K is successful, the retiree gets that income and it isn't a burden on the US taxpayer. But if the 401K tanks due to something like 2008/2009, the difference between what the 401K is worth and what that individual contributed over their lifetime is subsidized by the government.

After I asked her about visiting San Jose she quickly moved on to a say about how she felt that this place was filled with Asians (including folks from China and India). She felt a deep sense of unease, explained that her Son had to get an advanced degree before he could even find a job and that their family debt had worsened further. I was moved by her sense of discomfort and dug down deeper to understand what it is that she thought was the root cause of this problem. She said that as a kid she used to watch the news and feel hopeful that our country was headed in new directions of prosperity. Intelligence was respected and hard work seemed to be rewarded in appropriate measure.\n\nWhy then do we feel this sense of despair?

I can't expect you to have some sort of magical \"fix it\" button, and rather than hog all the question answering time I guess I'll focus on one thing in particular that's been bothering me, namely the idea of the unpaid internship.\n\nLots of jobs seem to require several years of experience in the field, despite being listed as entry level, and presumably the expectation is that you do an unpaid internship for one or two years. How is this even remotely acceptable? I understand that on paper an unpaid internship would be legal on the grounds that it'd be more like a \"come in and watch\" kind of arrangement, and therefore you get the benefit of learning skills for the profession, however it's no secret that an increasingly large number of companies and corporations are using unpaid internships as free labor. That is not legal, as I understand it, nor should it be as it is completely unacceptable, and yet the practice appears to be quite rampant.\n\nMoreover the idea that you even need to do an unpaid internship to get a job is ridiculous. While working for free debt accumulates and we're forced to spend our time not earning anything to help pay it off, as well as putting our lives on hold as we are not earning the means to go out and really start our lives.\n\nDo you have any plan to correct this?

Of course, the individual has the freedom to also be a racist, a sexist, or a homophobe, but if he causes harm to an individual he should stopped by the state. \n\nMy question to you, Mr. President, is do you think we should embrace a collectivist society where the government is the issuer of rights, or should Americans have all of their civil liberties protected?", "author": null}, {"body": "If you could pass any one law or change any one thing with absolutely no possibility of a negative result, what would it be?", "author": "Nekrosis13"}, {"body": "An American friend said this in a thread on Facebook last night:\n\n> I once asked a Canuck acquaintance if it's true that our neighbors to the north perceive us as a big, stupid, clumsy giant stumbling around smashing things. \"Yes,\" he said, \"that pretty much sums it up.\"\n\nHow would you go about changing this perception?

I'm not talking about the electoral college (though that could use an overhaul) but switching out our [\"winner take all\" or \"First Past the Post\"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_past_the_post) system with a more proportional system, such as [Single Transferable Vote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote) or [Mixed Member Proportional.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-member_proportional_representation)  \n\nIt seems that the vast majority of public dissatisfaction in our political system is indirectly due towards having little ability to use the pressure of the ballot box to ensure that politicians serve the public interest, and address the needs of all their constitutents, not just the 50%+1 people in their district that voted for them.  Additionally, there's little disincentive for corruption, as people are unlikely to vote against their ideological interests in order to throw out a corrupt incumbent.  \n\nWe also see that both major parties have agreed to support certain actions that public polling would suggest a majority of voting Americans would actually oppose.  I am by no means advocating a direct democracy, but it seems that the will of the voting public very rarely translates into actual policy, and that when it does, it seems more a coincidence than a concerned effort of the public's elected representatives and officials. \n\nIn practice, systems such as STV and MMP still retain two major parties representing broad liberal and conservative concerns, but allow for more voices that provide a balance and an incentive to keep politicians of the major parties more honest and more accountable for their actions.  It would also promote civic engagement, as votes under these systems are more likely to be statistically significant.  (I know I would get to the ballot box more often if I felt that my vote actually might have an impact on the outcome of the election!)  In short, having viable third party alternatives (keyword being \"viable\") keep major party politicians honest.  \n\nIn [Transparency International's Corruption Perception Index](http://cpi.transparency.org/cpi2011/results/), the highest ranking country was New Zealand, and New Zealand chose to move to an MMP system in 1993 via a referendum, and recently reaffirmed that it would keep the MMP system.

Any Redditors who can link to answers, I'd greatly appreciate it! :D\n\n1) Why the shift in executive policy on the drug front? While the rest of the Americas are urging for decriminalization due to the failure of prohibition to reduce the use and abuse of controlled substances, America maintains the same approach we took toward alcohol in the early 20th century. You stated we wouldn't be prosecuting medical dispensaries operating within the bounds of state law and then changed policy, shutting down many businesses and forcing medical marijuana back into the realm of criminal activity. Why?\n\n2) NASA is currently half a penny of every dollar in the federal budget. If you had control over spending, what would you sacrifice to increase funding for NASA?\n\n3) The Internet has revolutionized our world, changing how we learn, how we play, and how we do business. Internet access has become vital to modern life, yet there are still millions of Americans who are limited to dial-up or nothing at all. With Google pioneering incredibly high-speed FiOS access in limited areas, what can the government do to encourage similar investment and network improvement along these lines from the major ISP's while still ensuring that access to these high-speed connections is affordable for all?\n\n4) When the recession hit, millions of Americans found themselves out of work and facing foreclosure, resulting in the housing crisis. The government's response to this was to bail out the banks who owned the mortgages. Why did you and the Democratic Congress with whom you came into office choose to bail out the corporations? You could have instead bailed out the individual Americans instead - give the money to the people instead of the banks. The vast majority of those funds would have been used to pay off mortgages, car loans, student loans, credit cards, etc.\n\n5) The overwhelming majority of Americans are disgusted with Congressional partisanship and are losing faith in the two-party system. Yet every day I hear someone say \"I would vote for a third party candidate if they had a chance.\" Who is to blame for the feeling that third parties are a waste of time?\n\n6) On the subject of third parties, Gary Johnson has, last time I checked, not reached the 15% polling threshold required to get into the debates. Why do we have a 15% requirement in a system that is overwhelmingly two-party? Would you support changing it so that the 4 (or whatever other random number you prefer) highest polling candidates get invited to debates?\n\n7) Why have we not addressed the true issue in the healthcare debates - rising costs demanded by pharmaceutical and medical supply companies for drugs and equipment? We have the highest medical expenses in the world but remarkably low quality of care, considering the cost. Reducing the cost of providing healthcare would lower the cost of health insurance, yet nobody has addressed this. Why not, and what can be done to reduce costs?\n\nAnd that's all I can think of for right now.

Lessig uses the example of $100 vouchers to each individual for donation purposes, which would tip the scales towards citizen donations rather than super PAC donations. Also, he mentions how the system would be opt-in or opt-out, meaning that politicians who opt-in can't take corporate donations and only receives citizen vouchers, and opt-out, that is exactly the opposite.\n\n2. I know, just as much as you do, Mr. President, that our famed \"War on Drugs\" is a complete and dismal failure. I'll cut you a break and not make this about the \"Fast and Furious\" Scandal, but I'm pretty positive you know exactly what I'm talking about. Many nations around the world, and recently in Middle American and South American countries, leaders, politicians, social activists, etc have been championing the notion of discontinuing the War on Drugs in favor of a state-regulated system where those drugs could be safely distributed and controlled so that only those who say, have a prescription or an ID card to purchase a substance, could make purchases at specific locations..kinda like commercial pharmacies, except with more regulation. \n\nSo my question to you is: Will you, as the leader of the Free World, stand idly by as other peoples around the globe realize the faults of fighting drug abuse with force and that abusive behaviors are a health issue, instead of standing with these progressive thinkers and showing that you do with public policy that mirrors what is happening elsewhere? Will you tear down the walls of illegality and show the world that America believes in freedom, that America realizes that drug abuse pertains to health not punishment, and that this country understands the incredible mistakes of stigmatizing Marijuana usage for an entire generation?\n\n3. I would have a third point, but I have lost that stream of consciousness that provided for the first two and so I'll take this one to personally let you know that what you were able to accomplish in 2008 was remarkable. I stood in awe of your speeches and even teared up a bit as the newscasters announced your victory and as I watched your address in Chicago soon after. I wasn't old enough or rather didn't have enough time to get my voter registration processed to vote back then, so I donated here and there and even bought a pin to put in car to show my support how I could. This year, however, I stand ready to cast the vote I wanted to cast in 2008 and all I'm asking is for you to show me that my vote is worth it.\n\nThank you so much, Barry.

I have two questions for you, the first:  one of the biggest criticisms of your administration it that you \"haven't done anything\".

For example why not start moving to geothermal energy? This energy can give the whole world power for 15,000 years, and from what I've read and heard that's at minimum. Also there is tidal power that could do a lot to power all the cities by the coasts in the U.S. I also am wondering if there is going to be any help for the homeless for your second term. It has been said that there are 38 vacant homes in America for every 1 homeless person. Not all people choose to be homeless and when they are it is very difficult to find a job since there is no address for them, or they have a mental illness and are being passed by. Perhaps some of those homes could turn into stable shelter where they could have a permanent address and  perhaps do work for their shelter so they can have a permanent roof over there heads. I have one last question. There are many slaughter houses in the US that use cruel and torturous methods on their animals. In your second term would you try at all to outlaw these methods and make it so that the animals can have a decent life before they give their lives for us (i.e instead of cows eating corn which cows are not suppose to eat, allow them to eat grass, and instead of being stuck inside cages allow the animals to be free range). I'm not sure exactly what can be done perhaps put fines on them or something like that, but it's not fair to the animals at all. 1/3 of the worlds food yearly goes to waste. Perhaps if less food was made less would go to waste giving more room for profit, and better lives for the animals.

Of course, presidents have come and gone through rough times, but they are not quite written in the history books as we are living through your tough time as a president. Masses somehow blame you for all the terrible things that are due to the Bush Administration and claim that you have taken away their rights and freedoms.

Through thick and thin, the US has strived to progress and to shape itself into the best nation in the world, even if the leaders of the time made their mistakes, even if they were corrupt, the US still stood as a nation of progress. The \"natives\" trashed the foreign masses pumping into the harbors, they killed the actual natives of these lands, they fought wars against many other nations for many reasons. Yet, through all of this, the US still worked for a universal progression, even if the child workers suffered, even if the farmers did not get paid enough, and even if the sons of the nation died on the battlefield against their foreign or domestic brothers. Today, I see the US as being a failed state in the rest of the world. Hate still lingers around citizens, especially the GOP supporters. The political debates are all jokes.\n\nThis nation now condemns logic and reason, progress and science. This nation condemns the forward movement of success in any way. I know this is not the view of all Americans, but it is part of the most voiced opinions. The GOP is a freak show, loud and proud of their ignorance and arrogance. What happened to the days when the Republican Party was respected? I hope this is not the end.\n\nHonestly, what I see in your campaign and what I see in you as a person is an honest and joyful person.

Do you feel that this was a huge obstacle during this past term? \n\nAlso, In a country where people (and parties) are so divided on so many issues (and there is inherent competition between the parties) how could this kind of friction be prevented from occurring if you are re-elected? Do you believe that the current system can allow for both parties to truly work together? What would need to change for this to happen? \n\nThank-you very much if you can answer these questions.

So they have to get a loan from the federal reserve bank ( witch is not a a federal it is privately owned by private investors) but who puts money into the Federal reserve bank? No one does, the Federal bank calls up the US Mint and the US Mint prints more money, with that being said the Federal reserve bank loans money to the government thus the government gets charged interest witch means the governments tax's the people to pay of the loan off and yet the us government borrows more money with interest and the dept keeps rising.

I'll warn you that many mothers like me with young children are very angry and frustrated that our concerns and issues are being ignored or not taken seriously.  My generation (b. 1968) seems to be displaced and bypassed and we're increasingly creating our own digital (or physical) societies to counter the government (i.e. for me - writing for opensource.com).  By the way, I was an archive intern for the ACLU, so I've read all kinds of nasty things the government did in the 60s and Bush elections.\n\nEducation - is a complete, utter mess in this country.  I am a former public school history teacher and left the profession after a few years because it was so divisive, reactionary, and unreceptive to change.  Today, I am unschooling my 6.5-yr-old son (along with many other former public school teachers) because I feel the public schools have failed me and my son.  Alarm bells should be going off in this country with the state of education.  We are not investing in our future if we do not educate our children wisely.  We have been fools and will pay dearly if we do not change our ways.  Forget the money.  We don't have a creative vision and the writing is on the wall!\n\nFamily values?  There's none.  Morals?  There's none.  We stay-at-home (liberal, feminist) mothers are nearly hunted down by economics to extinction.  It's all about the money.  Nothing for the children, only how to exploit them.\n\nWhy the Race to Top when so many mothers, like me, see it as a Race to Nowhere?  Are you familiar with Pink Floyd's song, Time?  Why do you have a white, male baby boomer running the education department who is promoting industry rather than someone (female please) with young children who actually may have the maternal drive and instincts to steer a sinking titanic??\n\nWhy is Early Intervention slow to embrace neurofeedback/biofeedback in treating a wide range of special needs and treatment for children?  \n\nWhy are we not investing in neurofeedback/biofeedback to treat PTSD or a wide range of brain-based disorders for women, men, and children - in hospitals, schools, etc.?\n\nWhy do we still not invest in breastfeeding?  Women should be able to freely breastfeed in public places with donated breastpumps, if necessary in a separate room (not in a toilet stall).  Why can't women use police, fire, pubic libraries, town halls, etc. as a safe heaven to breastfeed?  Why aren't there any breastpumps in schools for teens who already have a baby in tow?\n\nWhy are we not investing in rainwater collection on the roofs of our houses like they do in Bermuda?\n\nWhy does every president have a library?  Why isn't there just one?  I thought we weren't into idolatry or kings?  Perhaps they not mere mortals?

Despite working 18 hour shifts, every single day, for these past 30 or so years, I've been letting myself get pushed around by the IRS, other smaller firms, banks and what have you, and still, after 30 years of living in this country, I haven't even achieved a solid life. I'm a roaming nomad, renting a different apartment every year, where I lose thousands of dollars to different leases (and goddamned protection money), and my life-long dream to purchase a house for myself has been eliminated, as my new goal, living in America is merely to survive on what I earn as income, and to allow my children a proper learning environment, proper entertainment, and enough food to get through the day. I've had thoughts about looking out for welfare, but I guess I'm too nice to ask for benefits in a country that's given me a luxurious life, compared to what I lived in back in Bangladesh. So, Mr. Obama, if I vote for you and you gain another 4 years in the oval office, would you have enough time and commitment to work your butt off fighting for the lower and middle-class like me and my family? I just want enough money in my hands to buy a small house, living in cramped apartments have ruined my children and my family is falling apart (well, mostly it's me and my wife fighting because we can't get anything done with the income we have, the children get along sometimes, but they don't have the modern technological access other children of America have today).\n\nThank you for being our President Mr. Obama, and I'll make sure to vote for you.", "author": "Zayadur"}, {"body": "Mr President.

The other party has two ideas for growth - more taxs cuts for the wealthy (paid for by raising tax burdens on the middle class and gutting investments like education) and getting rid of regulations we've put in place to control the excesses on wall street and help consumers. These ideas have been tried, they didnt work, and will make the economy worse. I want to keep promoting advanced manufacturing that will bring jobs back to America, promote all-American energy sources (including wind and solar), keep investing in education and make college more affordable, rebuild our infrastructure, invest in science, and reduce our deficit in a balanced way with prudent spending cuts and higher taxes on folks making more than $250,000/year. I don't promise that this will solve all our immediate economic challenges, but my plans will lay the foundation for long term growth for your generation, and for generations to follow. So don't be discouraged - we didn't get into this fix overnight, and we won't get out overnight, but we are making progress and with your help will make more.\n\n**[View the full table](http://www.reddit.com/r/tabled/comments/z1q69/)** on [/r/tabled](/r/tabled)! | *Last updated: 2012-08-30 12:28 UTC* | *Next update: 2012-08-30 13:28 UTC*\n\n*This comment was generated by a robot!

You've stated that your administration would focus on providing help and treatment to addicts. You also routinely throw them in prison for being morally degenerate. As someone who has, and I quote, \"done a little blow,\" how do you justify the absurd notion that a 10-year prison sentence is less damaging to a human being than a cocaine habit?\n\n2. You have unilateral control over the way the Drug Enforcement Agency conducts itself and enforces the law. After this agency has botched hundreds of raids, and murdered dozens of innocent civilians, will there come a time when you acknowledge that the DEA is either too corrupt or too incompetent to be trusted carrying out paramilitary raids on peaceful human beings?\n\n3. The former Chief of the CIA (and common sense) tells us that your massive and unprecedented campaign of unmanned aerial assassination is creating more terrorists than it kills. You've assassinated several U.S. citizens, one of them a minor and an innocent - is the former Chief of the CIA safe from your warmongering totalitarian regime?\n\n4.

How you got elected had to of had something to do with your skin color and the black panthers scaring everyone into voting for you at the voting booths.

He rammed ghastly legislation through Congress in the form of ObamaCare, he repeatedly violated the U.S. Constitution, gave blanket amnesty to illegal aliens, spent billions of tax dollars on \u201cgreen\u201d eco scams, seized 2/3rds of the auto industry, embraced the \u201cOccupy\u201d thugs, and chummed around with union racketeers who make threats and commit violent crimes.\n\nHe lied about the terrorist attack on our embassy in Libya, he disrespected the military and their families,  lied about the \u2018Fast and Furious\u2019 gunrunning operation, and started another gunrunning operation in Syria.\n\nHe kowtowed to Islamic scumbags, and is such a Dhimmi to the point where he managed to make Bin Laden\u2019s demise look anti-climactic. Speaking of the war in Afghanistan, the anti-war movement, which usually crawls out of the woodwork during wars fought under Republican administrations, has seen its numbers dwindle and its protests fizzle out. For Obama supporters, it was never about the legitimacy of fighting back against the Islamofascist enemy; and  many of them endorse Al Qaeda and the Taliban, no matter how many atrocities they commit or how many wars they start. It was all about getting a Marxist elected.\n\nThanks to the sophomoric foreign policy of this half-wit, our national security and our position as standard bearer for a safeguard against the world\u2019s malefactors, has been disgraced.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got more work to do,\u201d Obama declared. Like the final nail in America\u2019s coffin.\n\nLike this:\nA $22+ trillion debt.  ObamaCare will increase family premiums by $3000, increase taxes on the Middle Class, create death panels, will cost an estimated $1.8 trillion annually, and the jackboots at the IRS will come after you with a penalty tax if you don\u2019t have health insurance. Don\u2019t think so? Obviously, you didn\u2019t read the ObamaCare bill.\nThe phrase, \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid\u201d, really doesn\u2019t matter to intellectually and morally bankrupt people.\n\nFor those with historical amnesia:  DEMOCRATS caused the downward economic spiral, starting with Clinton\u2019s Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac, forcing banks to comply with government-dictated subprime lending rates, to those who could not afford a home or to pay back the loans to begin with. Obama\u2019s former Secretary of the Treasury Hank Paulson, and Ben Bernanke, the current Federal Reserve Chairman, threatened Bank of America into accepting TARP.\n\nThe DEMS refused to allow regulation of the out of control programs and as a result, failed banks across the United States were seized by the FDIC. Barney Frank, Maxine Waters, and Christopher Dodd repulsed efforts by the Republicans to monitor and prevent the impending disaster.  \u201cThere are no problems at Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac\u201d. Which was bullshit on stilts, as the housing market subsequently collapsed.\n\nWe\u2019ve got the worst economy since the 1929 depression. Business are folding and GM is teetering on bankruptcy, again.  The housing market still sucks. Local governments are still fleecing struggling taxpayers for more money, and the idiots oblige. Obama created this clusterfuck, he did not inherit it. Remember that when he, his media hacks, and his constituency continue to blame George Bush for the next four years.\n\nAs for national security, the Al Qaeda and other muzzie terrorist groups, whom Obama insisted were dead, will continue their jihad against America, in particular.\n\nCharacter, integrity, courage, and honesty doesn\u2019t matter either. Obama is a sociopathic narcissist, a criminal, and a liar.  He and his regime has yet to be held accountable for the laundry list of crimes they\u2019ve committed. The list of malfeasance is a lengthy one.  Furthermore, the erosion of personal liberties in America has reached ominous levels and the way that most citizens\u2014with the exception of the Tea Party\u2014have submitted to the carnage is a sickening display of cowardice.  Thomas Jefferson would not recognize the country he helped create.\n\nThe election wasn\u2019t about who was best to lead the country, it was about Big Bird, rape, dancing horses, contraception, binders, gay marriage, and of course, blaming Bush.\n\nWhich means there are a lot of \u2018tards out there in the population who should be forced to take an IQ test before being allowed to vote or breed.\n\nThe malpractice of MSM knob gobblers who serve as dutiful propagandists, helped foist him back into office.   There\u2019s a population of sheeple who get their information exclusively from the leftwing mainstream media and believe everything they\u2019re told, in spite of the proof right in front of them that Obama is totally unfit to lead a Democratic Republic. Anyone with half a brain who studied his personality, Marxist philosophy and background, would have never allowed him within 5000 miles of a political office.\n\nAs the United States continues down a socialist abyss of more economic despair and threats to our national sovereignty and security, remember those who cast their ballots for this train wreck and remind them that they are responsible. Make sure you give them a hearty \u201ccongratulations, douchebags.\u201d\n\nIf you think the last four years produced the worst economy and national security you\u2019ve ever seen, you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet.  The nightmare that is B. Hussein will take an incredible toll on this country.  America has just slit its own throat.

In 2007 I said I\u2019d cut the debt in half.\n2. Failed trillion dollar stimulus. He promised this trillion dollar stimulus would reduce unemployment to 5% by now, but it has been over 8% for 43 straight months, with many millions quitting looking for work because they are so frustrated, and he will be the first President ever to end my term with fewer Americans working than when I started.\n3. Clearly I have no idea how the private sector makes jobs. he said to those who built there own businesses, \"you didn't build it.\"  400 economists recently came together and said Romney's plan would work, his would not.  Punishes the job creators and accuses Romney of being a capitalist. He continually says the millionaires and billionaires need to pay more. They are already paying most of the taxes and they are the job creators.  He blamed all our woes 4 years later on Bush predecessor,  when in fact it was his, and my leftist buddies Barney Frank, Pelosi and Reid whose banking policies of forcing banks to lend to credit unworthy, led to the housing collapse which CAUSED the mess we are in. Every other downturn was followed by robust growth, except for his term, because of my terrible polices.\n4. Gas prices have doubled since he took office. He refuses to allow drilling on public lands but gives money to Brazil and others to drill. He keeps lying about how we drill so much and what natural resources we have here but he have closed off public land drilling by over 50% and hampers the coal industry with over regulation. Obama in 2008: \"So if somebody wants to build a coal-powered plant, they can. It's just that it will bankrupt them because they're going to be charged a huge sum for all that greenhouse gas that's being emitted.\"\n5. His regulations, the most added ever, stifle economic growth.\n6. He has grown government so much so that now 25% of the GDP is federal government spending.\n7. His administration continually leaks classified documents that endanger our soldiers and allies. \n8. He bragged about killing Bin Laden, when he hypocritically campaigned against the means they used to find him. That got the actual Seals who killed him so mad they are campaigning against him\n9. He hired Muslim brotherhood tied terrorists to the government and is aiding the Muslim brotherhood dominated Egypt by reducing their debt and doing military exercises with them, while scaling back our exercises with Israel.\n10. He has stalled and delayed and appeased Iran as they march forward to develop nuclear weapons and daily say they want to wipe out Israel. \n11. He has tried to  bully, threaten, intimidated and repeatedly turned his back on Israel ( 49 borders, no building in Jerusalem) and had the word Jerusalem removed from the DNC platform as well as Hamas as terror, and Palestinans no right of return,. He realized that Jerusalem's omission was an error and lied and said he did not know, and when he instructed them to put it back, they did, but over a majority loud chorus of boos from the delegates. DNC convention has featured a large Muslim extremist sub convention.\n12. He helped push out our best Arab ally of the largest Arab nation Egypt Mubarack,  to be replaced by terrorist Muslim brotherhood leaders. \n13. He forbade the CIA and FBI from using the words Muslim or Islam when they investigate, making it impossible to do their job and caled Fort Hpood massacre of a Muslim killing our soldiers shouting allah akbar workplace violence.\n14. Obama refused to push for Israel to be included in an international terrorist conference. \n15. His cuts in defense are so horrible and deep that his own Sec. of Defense says it will jeopardize us, even as I promises the Russian president, in a hot mike I thought was off, he\u2019d be more flexible in cutting our missiles next term. \n16. He pulled the defensive rug out from Poland by unilaterally removing our missile defense there, so Lech Walesa explicitly endorsed Romney on his visit last month, something diplomats don\u2019t do. \n17.

He took credit for getting us out of Iraq when it fact the timetable I used was negotiated with Bush and Iraq. \n19. he took credit for three trade agreements, again all negotiated by Bush. \n20. His programs have devastated the poor, with record levels of poor now, 1 out of 6 Americans, and record numbers on food stamps 48 million. After Bill Clinton and the Congress worked so hard on welfare Reform and established tough work rules, I gutted them, increasing dependency.\n21. Obama's war on the Middle class: His programs have devastated the middle class. The average middle class family has lost 40% of their wealth in my presidency and average household income has decreased under me, $55,000 to $51,000 devastating the middle class. U.S. Debt Now $136,260 Per Household\u2014Up 50% Under me..  Record number home forclosures. \n22. War on the elderly  with Obamacare. He robbed Medicare of $716 billion to pay for his Obamacare which will hurt the elderly. Death panels and limited care wait. \n23. He promised Obamacare would reduce premiums by now which it has not, and he promised it would cost $900 billion more as a new entitlement,   when it was recalculated recently to add 2.7 trillion more to the deficit. \n24. He is an extremist on abortion, voting as a Illinois State Senator four times to ban medical help to babies who survive botched abortions, even though it eventually passed the US Congress 98-0. \n25. He has no plans to curb entitlements, which will go bankrupt soon without correction.  \n26. He took credit for saving the auto industry but actually in my 60 billion loan to GM, they ripped off the real investors and shareholders, lost half, the money which we will never get back, just paid off his union cronies, and should have let them go through normal bankruptcy which would have saved them without costing us 30 billion \n27. He has wasted billions on paying off my campaign contributors with huge loans to energy companies which went bankrupt.\n28. he has actually have only hate and lies to run on, slandering his opponents and the people that actually produce jobs in this country,  He knew he were lying when they said Romney was a tax felon, killed that lady, etc.  This has caught on with his delegates here \u2013one from California called Ryan Goebbels, one from Kansas called him Hitler, One said the RNC convention was a Klan meeting and a  NY delegate said on camera if she saw Romney she\u2019d kill him. \n29. His spiritual adviser for 26 years was an anti Semitic, anti American \"(not God bless America, God da-n America\" ) communist, rev Wright. He lied when he downplayed his association with Ayers. I actually got my start from a guy who brags about trying to blow up the Pentagon, Bill Ayers. My philosophical mentor was Frank Davis, Communist and the formative influences on my world view were the vicious anti Israel Arabs Rashid Khalidi and Edward Said. \n30.

Most management know nothing about condor and have no biology background, but they play politics to the point no one can get work done.

The new management in Ventura and their supervisor in Sacramento had forced two out three refuge manages to leave office. While my husband jungle with three refuges, they also wanted to know why he worth to be working there. They have spent days re-interview everyone in the office, and most of them worked there more than five years or ten years to know why they are working there. I think the management simply have too much time and mind to spend on politics, but they could careless about the condors and what's going on with the wildlife.\n\nI am also questioning that government working environment and govern agencies efficiencies?

The VA. Everything moves at a slower bureaucratic pace there than it did for the Logistics section of the Ordnance Corps. I was fortunate to have my folks to go back to, who were willing to support me until the day comes where I can (literally as well as financially) get back on my feet. It took 6 months from the time I submitted my medical records to the VA before I got any sort of treatment, disability, and so forth, and even then, they claimed I hadn't enough evidence for most of my claims (despite explicit details of surgery, dozens of forms documenting each injury, and a medical records file that was over 350 pages long). They even denied I had any back problems whatsoever (introduce me to a soldier who has no back problems and I'll introduce you to someone who's never been out of TRADOC).\n\n I have to drive from Durango, CO to Albuquerque, NM, for most of my appointments, which takes time away from either what pitiful job I could get or my schooling. My medical appointments can only be scheduled 2 or more months out, and sometimes I have to cancel because I simply cannot afford the gas money.\n\n To cut to the chase, do you have any sort of plans on improving the VA? My siblings-in-arms can't always wait for 6-18 months for some kind of documentation giving them the rights awarded to disabled folk. Many of us are barred from decent paying jobs because we our bodies can no longer take even the simple strain of working on our feet. Should those veterans who don't have families willing to house and feed them find themselves in my situation, they'd end up on the streets. It's difficult to find a decent paying job when we have no education, simply because we walked off the High School graduation stage, diploma in hand, and onto a jet headed for Fts. Benning, Jackson, Knox, or such. We need a better support system for our disabled vets than handing them their DD214 and telling them that \"The VA should get back to you within a year or so,\" and having them, veterans who've lived in a rigidly structured environment with a guaranteed (though 2011 was a bit sketchy) paycheck, go into a world with relatively no structure, no guaranteed pay, and no support outside of a suicide hotline (which we are afraid to use because despite briefings saying otherwise, admitting oneself for help will RUIN one's career).\n\nThank you for your time, Mr. President.", "author": "ShinInuko"}, {"body": "Can we agree that fighting the Taliban is a futile, useless war that is virtually un-winnable considering that our very presence in the Middle East is part of the reason that they are fighting us, not to mention the false pretenses under which we ended up there in the first place.

We've seen over the years what an economic boost having a robust space program can be -- not only does it create jobs, it inspires and gives the country focus on a positive and meaningful goal. The current budget for NASA is a pittance - think what could be done with double, or triple that amount?\n\n**Frankly, we need another Apollo moment, Mr. President -- let's plan to get a man on Mars by the end of the decade, and show the world that America is the most scientifically advanced and capable nation in the world, and can achieve what it sets out to do.**", "author": "peteyH"}, {"body": "Contrary to what some are claiming, President Obama *did* answer the question.  It just wasn't the answer you wanted.\n\nWhat Obama told you is that the issue isn't increasing the dollar amount.  The issue is how it's spent.\n\nThe President wrote, \"The key is to make sure that we invest in cutting edge research that can take us to the next level.\"  But we're not doing that.  Congress forces NASA to waste billions on pork programs like the Space Launch System that have no misson or destination.\n\nA lot of folks are under the mistaken impression that the problem is NASA doesn't get enough money.  NASA gets about $18 billion a year.\n\nBut NASA is a bloated inefficient bureaucracy, for many reasons.\n\nPrior to this administration, pretty much every significant NASA project went billions over budget and fell years behind schedule.\n\nOne reason is that historically NASA management has low-balled the true cost of projects, because if they stated the true cost it would scare the bejeezus out of Congress and the project wouldn't be approved.  So they get the program approved and then go way over budget, figuring Congress won't cancel the program having spent so much money on it.\n\nThe current administration has tried to put an end to that.  The commercial cargo and crew competitions pit private vendors against each other, competing for a government contract.  They have to complete milestones to get awards to move on to the next step, otherwise they don't get a dime of taxpayer money.\n\nNASA has estimated informally that it cost SpaceX about one-fourth what it would have cost NASA to build the Falcon 9 rocket.  The SpaceX Dragon capsule was about one-tenth of what it would have cost NASA.\n\nAnother major problem is that NASA is viewed by Congress as pork for their districts.\n\nExhibit A: the Space Launch System, known by its critics as the Senate Launch System.\n\nThe best SLS article is at:\n\nhttp://www.competitivespace.org/issues/the-senate-launch-system/\n\nIt explains how Congress ordered NASA to build a \"monster rocket\" as they described it, spending $3 billion a year for the next five years.\n\nWhat will it do?\n\nCongress has never said.\n\nSLS has no missions or destinations.\n\nBut Congress did order NASA to use existing Shuttle contractors.  They ordered NASA to design its parts using existing Shuttle technology.  NASA had no real say.\n\nWhy did Congress do this?  Because the major players on the space subcommittees and the appropriations committees represent states with NASA space centers, NASA contractors, and/or they get huge campaign contributions from those contractors.\n\nObama has proposed a human flight to an asteroid by 2025 as a rehearsal for a human flight to Mars in the 2030s.  Congress has failed to act on that proposal.\n\nContrary to what a lot of you seem to think, the White House has no determination in what the budget is for any government agency.  That's the purview of Congress.  Read the U.S. Constitution.\n\nThe White House submits an annual budget proposal as a general framework, but typically it's ignored by Congress, which does what it feels like.  No President has the authority to raise or lower an agency's budget.  That's the Congress.\n\nAnd contrary to what some have claimed, Obama has not cut NASA's budget every year.  The current administration has submitted four annual budget proposals.  The first three proposed increasing NASA's budget.  The current year is basically flatline.  Congress cut all four -- specifically the commercial crew program, because that is viewed by them as a threat to their SLS pork.\n\nThe numbers for who proposed what, and who cut what, are all on NASA's web site at:\n\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/news/budget/\n\nSee for yourself what this administration has proposed, and what Congress actually passed.\n\nAnother problem is that, under the U.S. Constitution, budget and appropriations are two different things.  The budget says, \"You are approved for *x* dollars.\"  But the appropriations committee determines how much you actually get.  So NASA might be approved for $100, but if the appropriations committees decide to give you only $90, you get $90.  If they decide to give you $110, congratulations, you get to spend $110.\n\nIn my opinion, this administration is the first one in a long time to try to get NASA to run efficiently.  NASA was created in 1958 to be an aerospace research and development agency, to be a crucible of innovation for both the private sector and for other government agencies.  It was never intended to be a space taxi service or to be Starfleet.\n\nI'm all for building Starfleet, but that's never going to happen in our current political system.\n\nInstead of Congress forcing NASA to use 1970s-era technology, we should be investing in 21st Century technologies that will reduce the time for space travel to other worlds.  For example, former astronaut Franklin Chang-Diaz is working on an ion engine that could reduce the travel time to Mars from six months to a few weeks.  But instead Congress forces NASA to flush $3 billion a year into SLS with 1970s-era technology.\n\nThe Obama administration has primed the pump for new technology with the commercial cargo and crew programs.  The savings from this new approach are extending the International Space Station from at least 2015 (when it would have been defunded under the Bush administation) to at least 2020.  We already have potential vaccines for salmonella and MRSA thanks to microgravity research; that potential is why so many private companies are now investing in technologies to get into low Earth orbit.\n\nBy the end of the decade, we could have 100 people living in space, either at the ISS or on the private Bigelow habitats.  We will have an entirely new space-based economy no other nation on Earth will have.\n\nSo the issue isn't what NASA's budget is.  The issue is how much we as a nation are spending, public and private, on space.  And what it's being spent on.\n\nThat's what the President told you.  It's unfortunate that so many people seem to have missed the point.", "author": "SpaceKSCBlog"}, {"body": "Can you not give us a stupid answer that makes no sense at all and doesn't even vaguely answer the question?", "author": "Rricecakes"}, {"body": "So is that a yes? ...a no?", "author": "RubberDuck_RainStorm"}, {"body": "That's why your administration cut funding to NASA, right?", "author": "zaptal_47"}, {"body": "If that's the truth, why did you endorse cutting funds to NASA?", "author": "Teretz_Commando"}, {"body": "On a related note: how do you plan on ensuring we inspire today's youth into becoming the engineers and scientists of tomorrow?

Thanks for the plug.  Just wanted to clarify that my comments were specifically about the ability of the Obama admin to try to encourage compliance with the Ogden memo.  Rob Mikos has published a fairly thorough <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1768127\">law review article</a> that discusses this issue and explains why the Ogden memo did not really provide any protection. \n\nThat said, it is also important to recognize that Obama could have done other things on this issue but hasn't.  For example, Obama could have picked better appointees--particularly to head the DEA.  He chose extremist drug warrior and Bush holdover Michele Leonhart for the job.  As some may remember, this summer Leonhart refused to admit that heroin and crack are more dangerous than marijuana.  Obama certainly could have made a better pick for the position.  He could have asked prospective nominees point-blank if they would honor the Ogden memo.  Instead, by nominating Leonhart, he all but guaranteed that the Ogden memo would be ignored by the DEA.  I think that the willingness of US Attorneys to ignore the Ogden memo also speaks poorly to them as appointees.  I think a fair US Attorney would have tried to honor Ogden's memo in good faith, even if he or she wasn't obligated to follow it.  Clearly, many of them simply ignored it.  Obama's administration could also have supported one or more of the congressional proposals to protect state medical marijuana laws.  To my knowledge, they've done nothing to back these proposals.  The list could go on.  \n\nSo, are President Obama and Eric Holder spearheading a coordinated strategy against medical marijuana?  I don't think there's any evidence of that.  I believe people who think otherwise may not have a full understanding of the relationship between the DOJ in DC and local federal law enforcement (again, Rob Mikos discusses this relationship in his excellent article.)  My best guess is that Holder genuinely hoped people would comply with the Ogden memo.  I imagine that Obama himself has probably given this issue hardly any attention (certainly he seems to do everything he can to avoid talking or thinking about this issue based on the lengths he goes to to ignore drug policy questions in public forums.)  But, are Obama appointees like Michele Leonhart and local US Attorneys cracking down on medical marijuana?  Obviously they are.  And, if Obama had nominated people who agreed with the Ogden memo in the first place, then there would never have been an issue about compelling compliance with it.    \n\nAnyway, those are only brief thoughts--it's impossible to convey all the nuances in an internet comments thread.  :)  But, I figured I would chime in to clarify the referenced comments of mine a bit.

It is a personal belief, based upon the few years I've had on this planet, that he, along with many others, genuinely want to create a better world for *EVERYONE*. He's doing an AMAA on a site known to be liberal, more importantly progressive, to the point of absurdity (this is a hyperbole but you'd be hard pressed to find more liberal sites taken half as seriously as this one). He knew coming into this that people would ask him why he has done nothing to very little to dismantle the oligarchy and institutionalized racism that holds this country back from reaching some truly wonderful heights. Any question or personal experience (excluding troll questions of course) that is relayed to him should not be taken off the table. We, as fellow humans, would be causing a great disservice to censor ourselves in such a manner.\n\nThis has been said elsewhere in this post, but I would like to reiterate the idea. As much power as the POTUS has to endorse, create, and veto policies (among other powers), he is still just one man in the machine that is global governance. In my eyes, when we do see him re-elected for a second term you will see more progressive changes to the above mentioned issues because he will have gone through the gauntlet created by those who do not want change (one example of the gauntlet would be the republican congressmen and some democratic ones). \n\nI'm not sure exactly how, as there are still many obstacles to be met, but mark my words, you will see some serious issues tackled by a president who has nothing to lose (since he can't run for a 3rd term and being POTUS is pretty much the pinnacle of political achievements, especially for two consecutive terms).

They already held their national convention, did you watch it...or even hear a mention that such a thing existed until just now? Is that just because that party is unpopular?\n\nNo, if each presidential candidate had 1 hour of free airtime daily in every state, or city, or whatever you want to set it to, and that hour must be spread evenly and equally so that each candidate receives the same amount of time during each time slot (of course candidates could request certain channels or times for demographic purposes and those requests would be handled equally) then I would have without a doubt heard of Jill Stein long before I did, as would many other people. If that happened people would suddenly realize, \"hey, the democrats and republicans don't really match what I want, but the Freedom party/green party/justice party/constitution party/etc..  wants exactly what I want. Now, you have more people aware and they get excited (they've never had a candidate they really believed in) and some of them will start volunteering for the campaign, and the party grows (or if people disagree, like with the Homeland Party of white supremecists they whither and die) and suddenly people start to believe a third party can win.

That's how it used to be, the public stations (ABC, NBC, CBS) borrowed the air from the public and as payment for that air they took a small amount of time every 4 years to ensure Americans were informed, then came cable and it was ruled that cable wasn't public airwaves and Shit went down hill. \n\nOther than completely changing to a system if proportional representation, publicly funded elections are the number 1 thing we could do to ensure the 2-party system dies as it deserves.

The official Republican platform is to fight against gay marriage and abortion.\n\n>he has been fighting to steal as much from others as he feels he ought to be able to steal? Great.\n\nUm... no.  Here's a question.  When you look at a country where there are people starving and others with a lot of money (I'm talking about income inequality), do you think, \"Wow, those starving people really need to get it together and work hard like the rich people?\"\n\nIt's a dearly held myth in America that people who work hard get paid for that hard work.  People like to believe that if you work hard, you get paid well and can own a home and send your kids to college.  People hold that belief so dearly that when they see people who are poor, they blame them for being poor--not working hard enough.\n\nThe *reality* is that class mobility is at an all-time low in the United States.  The *reality* is that people in America are rich because they are born rich.  People are poor because they are born poor.  \n\nYou can [take a quick look at this graphic on Wikipedia.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_mobility#Country_comparison) Of the nine countries studied, the United States was second to last for class mobility.  People born poor in France, Germany, Sweden, Canada, Finland, Norway, and Denmark are much more likely to be able to pull themselves up to a better position through hard work than they are in America.  \n\nThink of it this way.  People born into a family with not a lot of money are going to go to public schools.  If they live in a poor area, the schools aren't funded very well.  Those kids share textbooks and aren't able to bring books home to read.  Contrast that to students who go to wealthier public schools.  The public high school I went to purchased graphing calculators for all the students to use for standardized tests.  Now, tell me, which students are going to get accepted into college?  The kids born poor with no text books to take home, or the ones born into a better environment who have their own books and graphing calculators?  \n\nNext, let's address the work issue.  Kids born into a financially stable family probably don't have to work.  They might pick up a job in the summers to learn responsibility.  Kids born into a poor family have to work while going to school.  Again, who is going to do better in school?\n\nNow, when it comes to the idea of going to college, those wealthier kids are more likely to be accepted into college because they are more likely to have done better in school because they went to a wealthier school than the poor kids.  Guess what?  They're more likely to get academic scholarships, too.  So, the more wealthy kids are more likely to be accepted to college *and* are going to get more help paying for college than the poor kids.  Students with wealthy parents also tend to have good connections because their parents have good jobs.  So, they get set up for good internships.  They are able to focus on school, get into school, not base their school decision based on costs, get an internship, and get a good paying job.  No matter how smart a poor child is, that poor child can't compete with all those advantages.\n\nAnd, so, the system is set up so that wealthy people stay wealthy.  Poor people stay poor.  We try to help the system a bit by making funding less local.  OK, so poor communities have poor schools.  How about they get more money from the state and federal government?  Well, wealthy people don't want to lose their state and federal funding because they'd have to pay more taxes in local taxes.  So, they call it socialism and say it's punishing success.  OK, well, how about we require colleges to accept a more diverse range of students?  How about we say colleges have to accept some students who are poor?  They have to accept more minorities?  Well, wealthy people say that's reverse-racism and socialism.  OK, so how about we help poor students pay for college?  Let them have a chance to succeed?  Again, wealthy people dismiss that and say it's socialist and that not everyone is meant for college.\n\nSo, we have a system that makes it so the wealthy people stay wealthy.  Those people tell everyone else that the system is a good system because the government stays out of their lives and doesn't \"punish\" them.  Of course they like the system.  They stay on top, and their kids stay on top.  \n\nNow, sometimes, the working class people *are* able to make changes.  The people of America have done a lot--through protesting, strikes, and government--to help the poor and middle class. This Monday, we're celebrating Labor Day and celebrating what all the working people were able to get accomplished by banning together. Do you enjoy the 40 hour work week, with paid overtime for hourly people who work more than 40 hours?  Thank unions!  Thank the working people!  Do you appreciate the laws against child labor in our country?  Thank the unions!  Thank the working people!\n\nEvery time working, middle class people band together to try to get something done, the wealthy people cry about it and say it'll be the end to business as we know it.  They say businesses won't be able to survive and they will shut down and no one will have a place to work AND WE'LL ALL SUFFER. Well, when Bill Clinton's administration raised the minimum wage when he was in office, did that shut down businesses? No. Did the idea of paying workers over time when they work more than 40 hours shut down businesses? No. Did making businesses give employees paid 10 minute breaks every few hours shut down businesses? No!\n\nWhat are today's issues? Well, workers today are trying to fight to get people sick days. In the state I live in, people have been fighting to make it so companies have to give their full-time employees two sick days every year, and they have to give their part-time employees one sick day every year.  **Sound the alarms!**  Republicans are acting like it's the end of the world.  They are literally telling everyone that if companies have to pay people 2 sick days a year, they won't be able to compete and will close down or move their businesses elsewhere.  Because of a day of sick time.  What.\n\nThose scare tactics are ridiculous.  That is absolutely insane.  If I wanted to open a business, and I would fail at it financially by giving my employees all 2 days off a year, well, then maybe I shouldn't be opening a business.\n\nI've worked a lot of food service jobs in the past.  We never got any sick time.  I've worked at smoothie shops, ice cream shops, coffee shops, and more.  The policies at every single one of those is that you have to show up--even if you have the *flu*--unless you can call around and find someone who will agree to take your shift. I have worked with an insane amount of sick people. If we couldn't stop sneezing and coughing while serving people's food, we just say, \"Oh, it's allergies.\"  No, it's the flu.\n\nWe are the only developed country that doesn't offer paid maternity leave.  We are one of the only developed countries with no paid vacation time or sick time.  Our taxes are so low that a lot of companies pay *no* taxes.

Think of the government as a parent figure.\n\n(As a side-note has our form of government just replaced the old version of *kingship* with a new many limbed body?)", "author": "Buy_Jupiter"}, {"body": ">I agree that the government shouldn't be involved in women's reproductive rights and shouldn't ban gay marriage. Those are Obama's stances.\n\nThey are not Obama's stances. Obama's stance on women's reproductive rights is that individuals calling themselves government should use threats of force to coerce other individuals into paying for women's reproductive services against their will. His stance on gay rights is that gays, for example, ought to be able to become members of the class privileged by government to be robbed less by the IRS. His stances are nothing anywhere close to getting government out of those issues.\n\n>Um... no. Here's a question. When you look at a country where there are people starving and others with a lot of money (I'm talking about income inequality), do you think, \"Wow, those starving people really need to get it together and work hard like the rich people?\"\n\nNo, what the hell does it mean to work harder anyway? Who cares how hard a person works? If you work 14 hours a day painting houses with a toothbrush, and you expect to be paid the same as someone who can paint 8 hours a day and cover 500 times more area than you, you're out of your mind.\n\n>The reality is that class mobility is at an all-time low in the United States. The reality is that people in America are rich because they are born rich. People are poor because they are born poor. \n\nThe reality is that the rich use government to secure their position and their wealth. They can't themselves use force and violence to keep competitors out of the market, because then they look like bandits. They instead have the government do their bidding, by having the government write complicated, expensive, and ridiculous rules, under the guise of protecting consumers, and sending goons to shut down competition before it has a chance to eat into their market share. The result is that the rich are protected from competition, which they abhor, by the government, which they love.\n\n>Think of it this way. People born into a family with not a lot of money are going to go to public schools. If they live in a poor area, the schools aren't funded very well. Those kids share textbooks and aren't able to bring books home to read. Contrast that to students who go to wealthier public schools. The public high school I went to purchased graphing calculators for all the students to use for standardized tests. Now, tell me, which students are going to get accepted into college? The kids born poor with no text books to take home, or the ones born into a better environment who have their own books and graphing calculators? \n\nLiterally no one in the entire world claims that rich children don't have an advantage. I don't see what the point in this exercise is.\n\n>No matter how smart a poor child is, that poor child can't compete with all those advantages.\n\nWhat's your point? The poor child, assuming he hasn't been hobbled by government schooling, government regulation, government laws against victimless crimes, government dependency, or any other roadblock thrown in by government to protect the rich from competition, can raise his own standard of living, to the point where his children have a better shot at life. That is what humans have been doing for all of eternity. It doesn't matter if the rich kids do better than he does, it matters that his own life is improved.\n\n>And, so, the system is set up so that wealthy people stay wealthy. Poor people stay poor.\n\nYes, the government system, set up by the rich as it always has been and always will be, is set up precisely that way. The free market, on the other hand, works so that the poor have a chance to slowly better themselves to make their children's lives are better.\n\n>Do you enjoy the 40 hour work week, with paid overtime for hourly people who work more than 40 hours? Thank unions! Thank the working people! Do you appreciate the laws against child labor in our country? Thank the unions! Thank the working people!\n\nDid you learn all of that from your public school teachers? What do you think would have happened 200 years ago, before capitalism brought about a massive rise in the potential productivity of workers, if unions had come in and told people they could only work 40 hours per week and their children couldn't work? They'd tell them to fuck right off! Why? Not because people like working long hours, or they like their children laboring, but because they don't like starving. Only when capitalism made it possible for people to be so productive that they could produce enough in 40 hours per week to sustain an entire family was it possible for the unions to come along and take credit.\n\n>Well, when Bill Clinton's administration raised the minimum wage when he was in office, did that shut down businesses? No.\n\nNo, of course not, they just fire people who aren't productive enough to justify being paid the higher minimum wage, and instead hire more skilled people who are worth that wage. Sorry, poor people, you're not productive enough to work in this country.\n\n>Did the idea of paying workers over time when they work more than 40 hours shut down businesses? No.\n\nOf course not, businesses just stopped paying people to work more than 40 hours, resulting in higher prices for customers, a lower standard of living for customers who depend on those prices to be low, a lower standard of living for the workers who couldn't work extra hours any more, and less opportunity for workers to move up by gaining extra skills by staying longer to learn from more productive people. Of course the biggest businesses see little to no change because their lawyers can find ways around all of those regulations.\n\n>If I wanted to open a business, and I would fail at it financially by giving my employees all 2 days off a year, well, then maybe I shouldn't be opening a business.\n\nYou're not just saying \"maybe I shouldn't be opening a business\", you're saying \"if your business can't fulfill these regulations when getting off the ground, you should just leave it to the big guys to take care of that market\". It's none of your business whether other people agree to work without 2 days of sick time. If that's what an employer offers, and that's what an employee voluntarily accepts, what in the world gives you the authority to tell them they can't do it?\n\n>We are the only developed country that doesn't offer paid maternity leave.\n\nWhat a ridiculous statement. Plenty of businesses offer paid maternity leave.\n\n>We are one of the only developed countries with no paid vacation time or sick time.\n\nAnother absurd statement. Plenty of businesses offer paid vacation and sick time.\n\n>Our taxes are so low that a lot of companies pay no taxes. \n\nGood. They should be lowered so none pay taxes.\n\n>Companies pay no taxes, and the working people get no benefits. \n\nAnother ridiculous statement. They get paid by their employers.

Following a response like this generally results in insults such as that I\u2019m a nut, insane, evil-capitalist, etc.  But since you didn\u2019t go on that far, then I will concede that this debate is definitely worth my time, and I will try my best to convince you why I am right, economically, morally, and practically, and why you are wrong in every direction.\n\n\n \u201cMy understanding of private property is that it's perfectly fine if an individual wants to create his or her own business, but if they require hiring someone else to aid them in that, than that person should be entitled to be without a controller and have a say in the business, and what must be stressed is that this can happen in many different ways because up to those involved\u201d: This is just completely full of fallacies and contradictions.  First you state that you agree with private property.  Then you contradict yourself by saying that it is limited.  Limited to whose whims, the whims of the person I hire, the quasi-government necessary for you philosophy to work, or who?  It seems you have lightly defined your principles as to where you draw the line.  Morally, this point needs great heed.  In anarcho-capitalism, the paradigm of completely non-aggression must be set.  Not literally by everyone, but it must be understood that it is only logical that one man should not attack, plunder, or control another.  Therefore, in anarcho-capitalism, people must trade voluntary.  For example, if I want to obtain your shirt there are only three ways I can do this.  (1) I can offer you a price.  In this instance we are making a contractual trade, thereby granting ownership of the shirt to me, and in return you receive my dollars or whatever I may have bartered with.  (2)  I can steal this.  I can blatantly rob you and take your shirt.  I\u2019m sure morally we can both agree that this is unjust, so this should be excused.  Lastly, (3) I can become a demagogue and convince everyone that we should have a vote on who obtains the shirt, and if I can convince everyone that I will enjoy the shirt more than you, I should therefore receive it.  You may have homesteaded it, but because everyone who is voting on my behalf believes I should have it, you no longer are allowed to have possession of it.  Now I am going to assume that this is the method you most are sympathetic too, or a mixture of 1 and 3, but if you are any of three, then that just contradicts 1.  So I will base my subsequent arguments on number 3.  \n\n Now we are dealing with democracy; AKA mob rule.  This paragraph will first demonstrate why democracy is inefficient in economics, and in ethics, and later I will further discuss your point.  In economics, trades cannot be dictated by majority vote.  It must be dictated by individuals.  Economics does not deal with the trade through arbitrary force, it deals with voluntary transactions between peaceful individuals, and sometimes not so peaceful (gangstas).  I personally believe in highest of moral societies, everyone has a right to their life.  We can hopefully both agree on that, if not, you are simply a brute who enjoys usurping the benefits of other men\u2019s achievement.  I will assume you aren\u2019t a lunatic so we can move on.  Now if I have a right to my life, that then means I must have a right to my body.  If I do not have a right to my body, I therefore mustn\u2019t have a right to my life if it is subjected to the majority\u2019s whims.  If I have my life, and property, I thus have my liberty.  Liberty is what allows individuals to pursue their own goals and dreams.  Liberty enables man to start from nothing and become everything he could have dreamed.  Liberty allows fathers to save for their children\u2019s education, and liberty allows for people to trade their labour for other forms of goods.  Liberty, I\u2019m sure, is not what you are attacking here, so I believe we can establish that in a moral society, each individual is entitled to his own life, liberty, and property, because without the 100% right to one\u2019s property, then they also do not possess a right to themselves.  \n\nOne point I may add, if you attempt to argue that you can own yourself, but you cannot own property outside of yourself, then that is just a bundle of contradictions I believe we can avoid if you take 2 seconds to think about it.  I\u2019m not sure if you were thinking about doing it, but I hope that you can just understand that it isn\u2019t a system that is possible, if 100% property rights are respected.\n\nFurthermore, I will now address the employees.  Employees are not subject to the whim of the capitalist.  That is just non-sense.  Employees are making a voluntary trade; their time and effort for the exchange of goods.  This is completely voluntary and thus isn\u2019t morally evil or coercive.  To say it is, is an insult to man\u2019s intellect, considering the darkest societies only saw light again when man became more free to trade and more free to interact.  When voluntary trade is manipulated, chaos erupts.  Therefore, it is not capitalism vs socialism, or capitalism vs egalitarianism, it is capitalism vs chaos; nothing more, nothing less. \n\nYour argument that employees are entitled to a piece of the project has absolutely no foundation to it.  The argument completely falls on its face if you have any understanding of private property.  For example, say I hire a cook and a maid for my house.  Does this entitle them to a piece of my mortgage as well?  What happens if I marry my cook or maid, do they lose this entitlement because they are no longer a worker of mine, but a family member.  Do all family members share property?  After I have a child, does it become entitled to my goods?  ", "author": "Fragolupe"}, {"body": "There are too many contradictions without 100% private property, so if we are going to continue to debate after this response, we must establish why 100% private property must be established. \n\nUltimately, if I hire someone, we are making a voluntary trade.  Meaning, because this person was incapable of creating his/her own business, I will have to take that risk, and they will have to work for me and not the reverse.  When I build my factory, it is MY factory and no one else\u2019s.  Because I hire someone, it does not mean I lose my privileges to my property, it only means that I have made a trade with another individual.  These types of trades are written on contracts or are implicit.  However, imagine that every time I hired someone they received a piece of my land.  That wouldn\u2019t be on the contract that I would make, that would be on the contract that the society would FORCE upon me.  I did not accept that voluntary.  I did not create my business through thievery or immoral deeds; I traded my property for other people\u2019s property.  I hope that you have realized that in order for your anarchist society to work, it necessitates control, force, and brutality.  These aren\u2019t intelligent ideals, and neither are they ideals.  It is not idealistic to coerce a man against his will, it is also not just to appropriate another man\u2019s property.  These are the words of a collectivist, an adherent to slavery. I will later address why mine isn\u2019t slavery, and why your society necessitates it.\n\n\u201cWhile voting is indeed taking place in the sense of choosing who to support in the market, it is quickly nullified as those with larger shares in the market are drastically able to cast \"stronger\" votes than others.\u201d:  Fallacy, after fallacy, after fallacy.  The consumer is sovereign in the market.  The businessman must produce at the will of the consumers, if the consumer does not buy it, then the product will not be produced.  Plain and simple.  Your argument that votes are not equal is completely absurd.  First you have presupposed that if I have more resources being spent into the market, then I must be bombarded by the society to stop it.  For example, I have a million dollars, and you have 100 dollars.  Assume that I go and buy 20,000 apples and you buy 2 pears.  What has changed?  Is this somehow unjust?  Pears will not go out of business, and apples will only temporarily go up in price.  But I still made a voluntary trade, you still made a voluntary trade, and thus there needs to be no concern over the issue.  Now let\u2019s pretend instead that I buy 1000 stocks of Wal-Mart.  What happens now?  If people stop shopping at Wal-Mart, my stocks become meaningless.  I do not have a further say in where people shop, only the consumer does.  \n\nIt seems your grievance with a democratic argument is that some individuals are wealthier than others.  If this is true, then you are a commy.  And if this is true, then this debate can be rested and we can both stop wasting our time with this pointless talk.  However, I will hope that it isn\u2019t true that you want individuals to all have the same income/wealth, which then concludes that you mustn\u2019t concern yourself with different inputs in the democratic market.  If you do, you then again place yourself in a bundle of contradictions.  There also aren\u2019t enough individuals who could maintain a complete control over how the markets work, because markets can only work for the benefit of the consumer.  Yes, here and there businesses mess up, but if they do not satisfy the consumer, how can they be satisfied?\nIn a world of 7 billion people, good luck casting TOO strong of votes; that assumption is completely fatuous and deserves no heed whatever.\n\u201cFurthermore, a free market is necessarily unsustainable due to monopolies. Individuals can vote all they want but it is always good business practice to eliminate competition which sometimes happens by design, or happens simply by \"acts of God\", say an earthquake strikes at the main processing plant of one company and not the other and so now the catastrophe stricken company can no longer compete and is bought by one of its competitors, and so you're left with the inevitable formation of monopolies which means that your democratic economy is now a kind of polyarchy.\u201d:  As I said before, only anarcho-capitalists truly study economics.  I\u2019m going to copy and paste my essay on monopolies below, if you want to read it and clear this fallacious argument up then be my guest, monopolies are usually the biggest mistake people jump on.\nEssay: Monopolies: A Public Misunderstanding\n\tTime and time again, capitalists and entrepreneurs are attacked for their unwavering selfishness and greed.  The epithets of \u2018evil\u2019, \u2018individualist\u2019, and \u2018exploiter\u2019, have falsely stigmatized the business owners in society, and have plagued all forms of media that portray these individuals.  However, a capitalist is simply and individual, evil or not, who saves a vast amount of wealth.  An entrepreneur is an individual who estimates future conditions in the market, and acts in accordance with their predictions.  Therefore, any individual can amount to this position by properly accumulating capital, and investing it intelligently in the market.  This action is not morally evil, but rather on the contrary.  The businessmen are those who take the biggest risks, and therefore also receive the biggest gains.  They produce for the sake of achievement, and not simply for the sake of status.   This understanding of capitalist-entrepreneurs has been lost over the last two centuries, and the public status of these people has suffered as a result.  The public makes claims that the government is needed to step in and to make sure that the greedy entrepreneurs do not upgrade to greedy monopolists.  They enforce regulations, tariffs, anti-trust laws, etc.  This makes it obvious that governments and the electorate are ignorant as to what a monopoly is, how it forms, and how to get rid of it.  People must also ask themselves if they truly want to get rid of it; they must realize whether it is beneficial to society, or detrimental to the concerns of the consumer.    There are 3 forms of monopolies, 2 of which are excusable for their properties, and 1 that needs heed and greater examination to reveal its effects on the market, and on the no longer, sovereign consumer.  \n\tTo make a case against the current understanding of monopolies, first the distinction between a free market, and an interventionist /socialist \u2018market\u2019 should be elucidated.  In a free market, monopolies cannot exist.  They cannot exist as an evil to the world, but rather an illustration of the complete opposite.  In a socialist society, where the means of production are controlled by the government, monopolies are formed in every industry.  These monopolies are the violent controllers of business, and use the threat of coercion in order to maintain their position.  In the free market, it is impossible for monopolies to forcefully push out other businesses from the industry; they must, in order to be at the top of the industry, use voluntary exchange and voluntary actions to uphold their positions.  If a businessman refrains from satisfying the consumers, he/she will suffer the consequences and potentially will be excused from that industry.  This occurs because of a concept known as consumer sovereignty.  Consumer sovereignty implies that the businessman is working for the sole benefit of the consumer.  The consumers, as a collective entity, control who is selling what, for what price, and to whom.  They control the businessman; the businessman does not control them.  \n\tThe three types of monopolies are very different and distinguishable from each other.  The first monopoly is a business or an entity that is the ONLY distributor of a specific service or good.  This monopoly however, is easily excusable for the sake of this essay.  It is not inherently evil, and neither does it have detrimental effects on consumers.  Every individual is the only individual that can render the service of himself/herself.  Person A can is the only person that can perform Person A actions.  Therefore, this person is a monopoly over themselves.  This obviously is a non-violent \u2018monopoly\u2019 that needs no heed whatever.  If a person is opposed to this form of monopoly, they are anti-individualist and can only use coercion to control and forcefully make people use their services for their behalf.  \n\tThe second form of monopoly is the ONLY business in a particular industry that has little to no competitors and potentially can restrict output.  This monopoly is capable of forming in a free market; however, its characteristics render it voluntary and non-coercive.  This monopoly has sparked much debate in the economic community as to whether or not it should be combatted or praised.  Murray Rothbard did an excellent review on this topic and has completely eliminated the idea that this has negative effects on society, and has logically been able to define it as beneficial, or at least a representation as the most beneficial a business can get.  A monopoly usually is smeared together with its corollary, a monopoly price.  This monopoly price is supposedly intrinsic, and allows the business to restrict production and to raise the price over the \u2018free market\u2019 level.  But this form of monopoly cannot restrict output, and is inherently at the \u2018free market\u2019 price level.  It is a contradiction to say that a monopoly on ", "author": "Fragolupe"}, {"body": "the free market does not sell its products at a free market level.  As noted above, if this business, as people claim, restricted production and raised the prices above what they \u2018should\u2019 be, another entrepreneur will enter the market and see and opening to push this business out of the industry.  To analyze a monopoly price, it must be contrasted with a free-market price or a competitor\u2019s price.  But if there is not one to compare it to, then there must not be a monopoly price.\n\tIt is also immaterial to assume that businessmen do restrict output when they obtain this position as the only competitor.  There is absolutely no way of telling whether or not the business is restricting output.  There is a certain supply demanded by the consumers, as well a certain price.  Therefore, if there are no businesses seeing this \u2018opening\u2019 or attempting to compete with this \u2018monopoly\u2019, then there must not be any damage to the interests of the consumer.  Any talented businessman has to ability to produce the demanded product if it is being restricted by the other producers.  This then means that the businessmen on the free market frankly do not have the choice if they want to raise the prices of the good/service, it ultimately comes down to the consumer\u2019s wants and demands.  And if the businessman is unable to do this, there are then also unable to raise the prices of the goods, or else they would have a surplus of production which would in the end be wasteful.  Overall, this monopoly is not dangerous, and for a businessman to attain this position is highly honorable for his/her entrepreneurial talents.  \n\tLastly, before addressing the most evil and coercive monopoly, the argument that big firms will constantly buy out small firms needs to be eradicated.  A big firm has neither the capital, nor the mental capacity to buy out an entire industry.  It has never happened and never will on a free-market.   The capital required to buy out an entire industry would be astronomic.  Say one buys out the entire industry, they would then only resort to what has been noted above, that they still cannot restrict output, and cannot raise prices.  So even in the rare case (a miraculous case), a business was able to obtain their position by acting this way, it still would not be destructive.  John D. Rockefeller, capitalist/philanthropist in the early 20th century, completely dominated the oil industry.  He significantly lowered the price of oil for the consumer, and the achievements of his business are still in effect today.  However he dominated the business strictly through voluntary actions.  He never coerced or forced anyone out of the industry, nonetheless, he did buy smaller firms to make his time easier.  But contrary to his assumption, his time was not easier, but much more difficult.  Because there used to be so much economic freedom in the USA, firms would keep being bought out, and others would keep joining in.  Rockefeller continued to buy these firms until he realized they were playing games with him and making his purchases ultimately vain.  Also, the mental capacity it would take is in many cases too much for a single business to handle.  Economic calculation becomes ever more difficult when the business is becoming bigger and competition becomes smaller.  And in an industry like oil, it would be difficult for many to calculate properly the prices that should be put forward, what types of production should be used, what things are going to cost, future conditions of the market, etc.  This impediment makes it extremely difficult for a monopoly to form on the free market, thus making this form of monopoly also excusable.  \n\tThe last form of monopoly is the monopoly that maintains its position through force and/or government intervention.   This is the monopoly everyone should be concerned with.  A monopoly with this power can restrict output and raise prices to higher levels, ultimately hurting the consumer.  It cannot be dominated by other businesses; it has an unlimited supply of funds and protection from competitors.  In an interventionist society, the government provides tariffs, subsidies, and other methods of granting special privileges.  The tax payers are using their money to create monopolies inadvertently.  They are receiving a double hit because they are paying for the administration to operate the special privileges and the subsidies that are being used, as well they are paying a higher price.  The government does not have the consumer in mind when rendering these privileges, but rather the lobbyists and the crony capitalists.  A tariff is a tax that grants impetus to some businesses at the expense of the less efficient businesses.  It protects it from businesses that are competing around the world, and enables it to restrict output for greater profit.  The state also grants privileges by creating regulation after regulation in the work place which creates impediments for smaller, new businesses to emerge.\n\tBig companies adore these restrictions because it attacks the less efficient businesses which then help to avoid competition (in some cases they are the ones hiring the lobbyists).  Nowadays the restrictions and regulations are dozens of books long thus putting new entrepreneurs in risky positions.  Big businesses will simply hire someone to \u2018interpret\u2019 the regulations rather than dealing with it themselves; this is a luxury for the small businessman.  The government also makes getting a permit difficult to restrict business in particular areas.  There have been many incidents where the state has shut down new and better businesses to maintain the less efficient businesses which preceded them.  They do this by outlawing businesses from emerging that provide similar consumption goods in certain areas (i.e. Wal-Mart).  Although this may sound immaterial in the big scheme of things, it is only a microcosm of what the government does in the market.  \n\tTariffs do not only hurt the small businesses, but it also has a negative effect on the rest of the economy.  For instance, imagine that steel from outside of Country A received a tax every time it was imported.  This would then increase the costs of creating higher capital goods, consumption goods, and would ultimately decrease the output in most businesses.  The prices of the machines to make and process food would increase, farming materiel would increase, cars would increase, etc.  The list could go on, but overall it is obvious that the consumer and the tax payer are hurt the most.  To elucidate the fallacy of tariffs, imagine there is an artificial line across a city, and every time one crosses over it with a new material it is taxed.  The government would probably need to set up an army or some type of divider to ensure its success, but in the end people would be able to see its effects.  Borders on countries are not \u2018real\u2019 borders; they are simply dividing lines between different government jurisdictions in different geographical areas.  If there are tariffs around borders of countries, why not include borders between provinces, cities, or even households if they have proven to be beneficial?\n\tA monopoly that is created in a completely socialist country will share the same effects.  In a COMPLETELY socialist country, there must also be a completely socialist world.  Communist Russia was not full socialist, because it still had the markets of other countries to base their price system off of.  In a completely socialist country, monopolies become inherent and completely disastrous.  Governments do not compete with other businesses; they simply take over.  If a business run by the government is being \u2018defeated\u2019, they can simply tax more dollars and out-compete that business.   Essentially, a socialized system allows the government to expropriate the goods of the citizens, and decide arbitrarily where they will buy, how much they will buy, and for what price they will buy.  The citizens do not control the market (which does not exist in a socialist world), rather the oppressive government does.  In any instance which the government takes control of an enterprise, the resources necessary will rise, and the quality of the service will fall.  This is the type of monopoly everyone should be concerned with; it violates their rights as the consumer and as an individual.\n\tMonopolies have been for decades, misconstrued by the public which has stigmatized many scrupulous businessmen falsely.  The former two forms of monopolies are completely non-oppressive and voluntary.  The latter form is a representation of the coercive institution government deliberately creates at the expense of the consumer, citizen, and tax-payer.  When lobbyists and socialists ostensibly claim that without subsidies or anti-trust laws or any form of regulation, that businesses will form monopolies, what they are truly stating is that they would rather have a monopoly created through force, rather than a business that works efficiently and morally through consumer interests.  As Ludwig von Mises states, when a person orders the government to enforce a particular law, they are saying that there should be more police officers forcing people to do what they do not want them to do.  When a person states that a law should be more enforced, they are saying that more force should be used to stop others from doing what they want to do as peaceful individuals.  Nothing of this is voluntary, nor does it seem laudable.  Nonetheless, this is the paradigm people are living in, that coercion and government are necessary to maintain and preserve the well-being of mankind and its future.  \nI will now continue on with my argument.\n", "author": "Fragolupe"}, {"body": "\u201cBecause they must pay people to do the tasks that they're dependent upon it is inevitable that you have a rise in the standard of living, though I wouldn't say it's the best simply because raising the standard of living is not the goal of any capitalist, profit is.\u201d:  You mustn\u2019t have ever read an article on the basic benefits of profit-seeking.  I will elucidate the term for you since it appears you are unable to grasp its benefits.  If the consumer is sovereign, which has been established above, then businesses must try to find the best products for the consumer in order to reap the biggest gain.  That being said, profit can only lie where consumers are willing to buy things.  If businesses are constantly battling each other to produce the best product for the lowest price, how couldn\u2019t the standard of living not be going up at its fastest possible rate?  What other form of society can provide this at such an extent?  \n\nThe goals, the motives, and the dreams of any businessman must be completely eradicated in this equation.  The businessmen do not control the market, the consumer does.  The businessman does not control what the consumer wants, the consumer does.  If the consumer is the one purchasing all the goods/services, and the consumer is also the one deciding what is good and what is bad, then the consumer must therefore be sovereign in a free-market.  If you are against a free-market, then you are against freedom.  If you are against freedom, you are a brute.  If you are a brute, you are also a mystic.  You do not you reason and logic to come to conclusions but rather whims and emotions.  It appears so far you haven\u2019t studied even 1 book in economics, yet you already have an entire philosophy that takes control of the entire economy.  Prior to studying economics I didn\u2019t really have say on anything because I never really thought I was allowed to.  Here is a great quote by Murray Rothbard:  \u201cIt is no crime to be ignorant of economics, which is, after all, a specialized discipline and one that most people consider to be a \u2018dismal science.\u2019 But it is totally irresponsible to have a loud and vociferous opinion on economic subjects while remaining in this state of ignorance.\u201d \n\n\n\n\u201cFor profit to exist it is necessary, as I'm sure you know, for your cost of manufacturing to be lower than your selling price per widget or service. This means that it is also necessary that people be paid less than what their labor is valued at, and so you're left with proletarians being exploited by capitalists, those with control over the means of production.\u201d:  You sound like a marxist.  And you are a Marxist so I guess that would make sense.  You also sound slightly like John Maynard Keynes because you never seem to define your terms properly of efficiently leaving me to decipher them for you.  \u201cthis also means that it is necessary for people to be paid less than they are valued at.\u201d  Please, enlighten me on what their real value is?  Say that I can produce marginally $4.5 for the business.  Am I truly worth $4.5?  If I am, why don\u2019t I just stop working and do my own thing at my house, and reap all the profits?  No one is stopping me from doing that.  The reason why you can\u2019t do that is because you NEED to the entrepreneur.  If you didn\u2019t, you would just do it yourself.  And because you NEED me to make a higher wage for your work, we made a trade.  I will allow you to use my equipment, if you work for me.  Not become a slave for me, but if you WORK for me.  Let\u2019s now define work.  If I am working for someone voluntarily, am I really being exploited? I believe you are falling into the zero-sum fallacy, where one trader is at a loss, and the other is at a benefit.  But since that is a fallacy in economics it mustn\u2019t be true.  And wouldn\u2019t it only logically follow, that if you were trading your time and effort for my goods and services, that it must be benefitting both of us?  If we are both benefitting, why should we go any steps further to put me, the employee, in charge of the business decisions.  If I am just an artisan, how am I supposed to know all the tricks and gigs in the market-place, I have to rely on entrepreneur for that.  However, if the entrepreneur\u2019s property is going to be confiscated the second he hires someone, then there really isn\u2019t going to be any entrepreneurs.  I could keep rambling, but I think you get the picture that what you are saying doesn\u2019t make any sense.  If you cannot define exploitation from voluntary peaceful trade, then politics is not a good realm for you.  Religion and mysticism is where irrationality belongs.  But still, I will go on, because I believe you can make that easy, elementary distinction; if I trade with you, we are partners, not master and servant.\n\n \n\u201cPrivate property only refers to means of production, and it's private because not everyone who utilizes it to labor has control over it.\u201d:  This isn\u2019t true.  I don\u2019t know if you just heard this in the anarchist subreddit or what, but homesteading extends further than just mixing labour with land or means of production.  If I find a golden token on the ground in the Sahara desert, it essentially becomes my private property.  It is not the property of the world to take 1/7 billionth of it and keep it, it is my property now that I\u2019ve homesteaded it.  Private property of the means of the production is capitalism; I think that is where you are getting things mixed up.  If the means of production are not private, it is socialism/communism.  Hopefully that misunderstanding is eradicated and I can move on, you shirt IS private property.\n\n\u201cbut I would at least like a vote, which is a whole hell of a lot more than what I have now.\u201d:  A vote in what?  You want a vote on how McDonalds should be run, do you think your vote will benefit the consumer, or even you as the worker?  You\u2019re not the businessman, you are an employee, under voluntary contractual obligations.  You could pose the same argument you used against me here too though.  I could vote in a company like Wal-Mart do to certain things, and you could vote in a company like dollarama nowhere near the capacity of what Wal-Mart is capable of.  That then means that you have a lesser vote in the market, and I have a greater one even if we were to take your understanding of how reality should conform to you.\n\n\u201cRight now I'm a slave to capitalists. Because I don't have a vote in the means of production I'm left at the will of my employer. They have control over where I live, how I dress, what my hair looks like, how I live, when I can relax, etc. And even though some of those things may still exist, say a co-op votes to have everyone wear only casual clothes, and I want to wear a suit, but I stay there because I still want to be a part of the co-op, at least I got a vote, I was part of the decision, and I could take solace in the fact that, yes, I was outvoted, but everyone came to that decision equally and I just happen to be on without the majority.\u201d:  How does the saying go, \u201cthis doesn\u2019t deserve sober comment\u201d?  Something along those lines, I heard Walter Block once use this.  But I think because we are just beginning this debate it is necessary that I destroy it so you can see a greater light.  This comes back to the statement I said above though, if you cannot distinguish Voluntary transactions from slavery, politics and philosophy is not the discipline for you.  You are not being exploited, that makes llllllllllllllliterally no sense.  No one forced you to be there except the fact that you need to survive.  No human being has cursed you with this instinct, nature has.  And yes, you are left at the will of the employer, you go to work when they tell you to, you do what they tell you, and you go home when they tell you.  But didn\u2019t you agree to this?  Is this not the very reason why you are there, so that they pay you?  Please, go home and do what you do and try to do better.  If you can, then great, do it.  If you can\u2019t, then hopefully you can see where I am coming from.  You understand that you are better off under the wing of these great employers, who have provided the jobs and the means to success.  And yes, I\u2019m sure you may FEEL better having a \u2018say\u2019, but going by what you feel or hope is just whim worshipping, nothing more.  I would also feel better if I got 50% of the company, or a million bucks on my next pay check.  Why do you only get a \u2018say,\u2019 what if 50% of the people vote that you can have 20% of everyone\u2019s pay checks?  Why don\u2019t you receive complete ownership of the entire company?  The reason being is because you want equality, but if you fight for equality, you get a little amount of both equality and freedom, if you fight for freedom, you get the greatest amount of freedom and equality.  This derives from your rights to your life, liberty, and property.  When they are infringed upon by society, chaos erupts.  \n\nYou need to understand, that according to your philosophy, to get rid of coercion there must be put in place coercion.  If I cannot make voluntary contracts that allow me to own my company and hire employees, then only chaos can erupt.  The economy does not run the way you are thinking it runs and I think that is your greatest fallacy of all.  You assume that the economy will be as efficient as it would be under capitalism, yet you haven\u2019t read an economics book in your life (if you have it wasn\u2019t by a good author).  Economics does not tell you what is moral and not moral, it will tell you what you think will happen, and what actually happens under certain policies and manipulations.  Freedom is ultimately the issue here, equality can only be created through basic, negative rights.\n\n\nSorry that I put it in all these different messages, its just one wasn't able to contain it all, so if you copy and paste this into a word document everything would be easier for you.", "author": "Fragolupe"}, {"body": "*Why does me saying you have a boyfriend immediately make you think I am making a homo-sexually derogatory reference?*\n\nYou're even stupider than I gave you credit for.
