[{"body": "Here is a collection of all the questions and answers:\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mnkw)\n>I am recent law school graduate. Despite graduating from a top school, I find myself unemployed with a large student loan debt burden. While I'm sure my immediate prospects will improve in time, it's difficult to be optimistic about the future knowing that my ability to live a productive life -- to have a fulfilling career, to buy a house, to someday raise a family -- is hampered by my debt and the bleak economic outlook for young people. I know that I'm not alone in feeling this way. Many of us are demoralized. Your 2008 campaign was successful in large part due to the efforts of younger demographics. We worked for you, we campaigned for you, and we turned out in record numbers to vote for you. What can I say to encourage those in similar situations as I am to show up again in November? What hope can you offer us for your second term?\n\nAnswer:\n>I understand how tough it is out there for recent grads. You're right - your long term prospects are great, but that doesn't help in the short term. Obviously some of the steps we have taken already help young people at the start of their careers. Because of the health care bill, you can stay on your parent's plan until you're twenty six. Because of our student loan bill, we are lowering the debt burdens that young people have to carry. But the key for your future, and all our futures, is an economy that is growing and creating solid middle class jobs - and that's why the choice in this election is so important. The other party has two ideas for growth - more taxs cuts for the wealthy (paid for by raising tax burdens on the middle class and gutting investments like education) and getting rid of regulations we've put in place to control the excesses on wall street and help consumers. These ideas have been tried, they didnt work, and will make the economy worse. I want to keep promoting advanced manufacturing that will bring jobs back to America, promote all-American energy sources (including wind and solar), keep investing in education and make college more affordable, rebuild our infrastructure, invest in science, and reduce our deficit in a balanced way with prudent spending cuts and higher taxes on folks making more than $250,000/year. I don't promise that this will solve all our immediate economic challenges, but my plans will lay the foundation for long term growth for your generation, and for generations to follow. So don't be discouraged - we didn't get into this fix overnight, and we won't get out overnight, but we are making progress and with your help will make more.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mom8)\n>What's the recipe for the White House's beer?\n\nAnswer:\n>It will be out soon! I can tell from first hand experience, it is tasty.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mnz9)\n>What are you going to do to end the corrupting influence of money in politics during your second term?\n\nAnswer:\n>Money has always been a factor in politics, but we are seeing something new in the no-holds barred flow of seven and eight figure checks, most undisclosed, into super-PACs; they fundamentally threaten to overwhelm the political process over the long run and drown out the voices of ordinary citizens. We need to start with passing the Disclose Act that is already written and been sponsored in Congress - to at least force disclosure of who is giving to who. We should also pass legislation prohibiting the bundling of campaign contributions from lobbyists. Over the longer term, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United (assuming the Supreme Court doesn't revisit it). Even if the amendment process falls short, it can shine a spotlight of the super-PAC phenomenon and help apply pressure for change.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmg8)\n>What was the most difficult decision that you had to make during this term?\n\nAnswer:\n>The decision to surge our forces in afghanistan. Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you. The decision did help us blunt the taliban's momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014. But knowing of the heroes that have fallen is something you never forget.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm2v)\n>What is the first thing you'll do on November 7th, win or lose?\n\nAnswer:\n>Win or lose, I'll be thanking everybody who is working so hard - especially all the volunteers in field offices all across the country, and the amazing young people in our campaign offices.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60ml11)\n>How are you going help small businesses in 2013 and 2014? and what if any bills are you going to implement for small businesses, in 2013, and 2014?\n\nAnswer:\n>We've really focused on this since I came into office - 18 tax cuts for small business, easier funding from the SBA. Going forward, I want to keep taxes low for the 98 percent of small businesses that have $250,000 or less in income, make it easier for small business to access financing, and expand their opportunities to export. And we will be implementing the Jobs Act bill that I signed that will make it easier for startups to access crowd-funding and reduce their tax burden at the start-up stage.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm5n)\n>Who's your favourite Basketball player?\n\nAnswer:\n>Jordan - I'm a Bulls guy.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mlwx)\n>We know how Republicans feel about protecting Internet Freedom. Is Internet Freedom an issue you'd push to add to the Democratic Party's 2012 platform?\n\nAnswer:\n>Internet freedom is something I know you all care passionately about; I do too. We will fight hard to make sure that the internet remains the open forum for everybody - from those who are expressing an idea to those to want to start a business. And although there will be occasional disagreements on the details of various legislative proposals, I won't stray from that principle - and it will be reflected in the platform.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mm41)\n>Are you considering increasing funds to the space program?\n\nAnswer:\n>Making sure we stay at the forefront of space exploration is a big priority for my administration. The passing of Neil Armstrong this week is a reminder of the inspiration and wonder that our space program has provided in the past; the curiosity probe on mars is a reminder of what remains to be discovered. The key is to make sure that we invest in cutting edge research that can take us to the next level - so even as we continue work with the international space station, we are focused on a potential mission to a asteroid as a prelude to a manned Mars flight.\n\nQuestion: [Link](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/z1c9z/i_am_barack_obama_president_of_the_united_states/c60mmaf)\n>How do you balance family life and hobbies with, well, being the POTUS?\n\nAnswer:\n>It's hard - truthfully the main thing other than work is just making sure that I'm spending enough time with michelle and the girls. The big advantage I have is that I live above the store - so I have no commute! So we make sure that when I'm in DC I never miss dinner with them at 6:30 pm - even if I have to go back down to the Oval for work later in the evening. I do work out every morning as well, and try to get a basketball or golf game in on the weekends just to get out of the bubble. Speaking of balance, though, I need to get going so I'm back in DC in time for dinner. But I want to thank everybody at reddit for participating - this is an example of how technology and the internet can empower the sorts of conversations that strengthen our democracy over the long run.

I will now paraphrase what he told us:\n\nObama does not have the amount of control over local federal authorities that your questions presupposes.  Obama *did* promise that he wouldn't interfere with individual state decisions on medical use of cannabis.  In fact, after being elected, his administration (specifically, Eric Holder, I believe) published the Ogden Memo (Google it).  This memo basically directed local federal authorities to respect the states with medical marijuana laws, and not prosecute anyone as long as they are not in violation of the state medical marijuana laws.  *However*, local federal authorities ignored the Ogden memo, and there was not much the Obama administration could do about it.  The way Alex Kreit put it was to say there are not many \"levers to pull\" for the Obama administration, and that the positions that the local federal authorities hold (U.S. Attorneys, for example) were specifically designed so as to maintain independence from central control.\n\nBasically, as a result of all this, it's not really accurate to blame Obama for the fact that local federal authorities are shutting down dispensaries and arresting people.", "author": "Change_Is_Constant"}, {"body": "As a secondary point, what role do you think states' rights (surrounding drug legalization) will play in the rest of your presidency?

These ideas have been tried, they didnt work, and will make the economy worse. I want to keep promoting advanced manufacturing that will bring jobs back to America, promote all-American energy sources (including wind and solar), keep investing in education and make college more affordable, rebuild our infrastructure, invest in science, and reduce our deficit in a balanced way with prudent spending cuts and higher taxes on folks making more than $250,000/year. I don't promise that this will solve all our immediate economic challenges, but my plans will lay the foundation for long term growth for your generation, and for generations to follow.

Just wanted to clarify that my comments were specifically about the ability of the Obama admin to try to encourage compliance with the Ogden memo.  Rob Mikos has published a fairly thorough <a href=\"http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1768127\">law review article</a> that discusses this issue and explains why the Ogden memo did not really provide any protection. \n\nThat said, it is also important to recognize that Obama could have done other things on this issue but hasn't.  For example, Obama could have picked better appointees--particularly to head the DEA.  He chose extremist drug warrior and Bush holdover Michele Leonhart for the job.  As some may remember, this summer Leonhart refused to admit that heroin and crack are more dangerous than marijuana.  Obama certainly could have made a better pick for the position.  He could have asked prospective nominees point-blank if they would honor the Ogden memo.  Instead, by nominating Leonhart, he all but guaranteed that the Ogden memo would be ignored by the DEA.  I think that the willingness of US Attorneys to ignore the Ogden memo also speaks poorly to them as appointees.  I think a fair US Attorney would have tried to honor Ogden's memo in good faith, even if he or she wasn't obligated to follow it.  Clearly, many of them simply ignored it.  Obama's administration could also have supported one or more of the congressional proposals to protect state medical marijuana laws.  To my knowledge, they've done nothing to back these proposals.  The list could go on.  \n\nSo, are President Obama and Eric Holder spearheading a coordinated strategy against medical marijuana?  I don't think there's any evidence of that.  I believe people who think otherwise may not have a full understanding of the relationship between the DOJ in DC and local federal law enforcement (again, Rob Mikos discusses this relationship in his excellent article.)  My best guess is that Holder genuinely hoped people would comply with the Ogden memo.  I imagine that Obama himself has probably given this issue hardly any attention (certainly he seems to do everything he can to avoid talking or thinking about this issue based on the lengths he goes to to ignore drug policy questions in public forums.)  But, are Obama appointees like Michele Leonhart and local US Attorneys cracking down on medical marijuana?  Obviously they are.  And, if Obama had nominated people who agreed with the Ogden memo in the first place, then there would never have been an issue about compelling compliance with it.    \n\nAnyway, those are only brief thoughts--it's impossible to convey all the nuances in an internet comments thread.  :)  But, I figured I would chime in to clarify the referenced comments of mine a bit.

BigLaw (i.e., the tier of the largest, best-paying, most prestigious firms) more or less collapsed during our first semester.  Although the wider legal market might have been \u201coversaturated\u201d even then, prior to mid-fall 2008, students at top law schools were explicitly told that there would be no dearth of high-paying entry level jobs. The only people who should worry, we were told, were those guys at the tier 4 schools. We were told that everyone who didn\u2019t take a high-paying job upon graduation did so out of a desire to work in the public interest. This made sense; given that even those who planned to go into the private sector had to submit application essays about how we wanted to use our degrees to improve the world, you had to figure at least a handful of students were willing to forego a big paycheck in order to do work that they cared deeply about. When my class started to worry about how we would be affected by the onset of the recession, the schools continuously assured us that we would be \u201cfine.\u201d For a substantial percentage of the class of 2011, this has not proven true.\n\nI don't have quite as much sympathy for the classes that enrolled in 2009 and beyond, when there was clear evidence that things had changed, although you have to keep in mind that these enrollees were often being led over the cliff by assurances from very reputable schools that probably didn\u2019t have a full grasp on the direness of the situation. None of the schools seemed willing to come to terms with how quickly the value of a degree could plummet, and even now there is a somewhat deluded mindset from school administrators (assuming they aren\u2019t flat-out lying to keep themselves afloat). Courts have historically shown little sympathy for disappointed graduates who attempt to sue even tier 4 schools that have obviously misled enrollees about job prospects, so the administrators of top schools are essentially undeterred from continuing to misrepresent how their recent graduates are faring in the world, provided *U.S. News* doesn\u2019t take them to task for their shady efforts to manipulate hiring data (e.g., temporarily hiring graduates to work in the school library so they can list them as \u201cemployed 9 months after graduation\").

We share your view that NASA is a driver of innovation and economic growth, a creator of high-skilled and high-paying jobs, and a force for inspiration in the American people -- especially our youth. That's why President Obama has set NASA on course for a new and exciting chapter of American space exploration, one that will see more discoveries, scientific breakthroughs, and, ultimately, more Americans in space going to places never before visited.\n\nEven in the face of tough fiscal challenges, the President's plan charts a path towards continued American leadership in space by making every penny count. By investing in American companies -- and American ingenuity -- we are spurring free-market competition to give taxpayers more bang for the buck, while enabling NASA to do what it does best -- reach for the heavens.\n\nJust this past month, an historic -- and audacious -- event took place. For the first time, a privately owned American spacecraft launched and docked with the International Space Station (ISS) to deliver the cargo American astronauts need to do their jobs in space. This fundamentally new way of doing business for NASA includes partnering with innovative U.S. companies like SpaceX to embrace the efficiency, ingenuity, and resources of the private sector while allowing NASA to focus on challenges only its world-class scientists and engineers have the ability to tackle -- like sending humans beyond low Earth orbit for the first time in 40 years, outside the Earth-Moon system for the first time in history, and ultimately to explore Mars within the next couple of decades.\n\nNASA and space are so important to our future that we do need to be doubling and tripling what we can accomplish in this domain. That's why the President's plan for NASA more than doubles the number of U.S. rockets capable of going to the ISS. And the James Webb Space Telescope, which the President's Budget keeps on track for launch later this decade, won't just double Hubble's capabilities, but will be 100 times more powerful. This summer, Americans in a control room in California will be monitoring as an automobile-sized rover is lowered onto the Martian surface from a sky-crane hovering in the rusty atmosphere. The \"Curiosity\" Mars rover isn't just double the size of any previous rover -- but is also carrying 10 times the mass of scientific instruments as America's Opportunity rover currently operating on the surface. And with NASA's Kepler telescope currently in space, the number of planets identified as orbiting distant stars in other Solar Systems has not just been doubled, but multiplied several times over.\n\nThe Administration has worked with Congress over the last three years to develop a forward-leaning trajectory for NASA that places the agency on a more stable fiscal footing -- in part by joining forces with the private sector -- while still pushing the boundaries of inspiration and discovery. The key features of this plan include:\n\n* Extending operations of the ISS -- which has been continuously crewed since 2000 -- until at least 2020 (when President Obama came into office, it was scheduled to be decommissioned after 2015);\n* Acquiring crew and cargo transportation services to the ISS from U.S. commercial companies;\n* Pursuing new technology investments, like advanced in-space propulsion, to expand the reach, affordability, and potential of our space science and exploration efforts -- technologies that are required to send humans beyond the Moon;\n* Building the biggest, most powerful rocket ever -- set to be more powerful than the Saturn V vehicle that carried American astronauts to the Moon -- and cutting-edge crew capsule for deep space human exploration, including a mission to visit an asteroid in the 2020s and eventually Mars;\n* Leading the world in Earth and space science research vital to understanding our planetary home and unlocking the mysteries of our Solar System and the Universe.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone is supportive of this ambitious effort. Rather than making bold, targeted investments in our space future and embarking on new partnerships with the private sector to ensure every taxpayer dollar is spent wisely, the proposed Republican House budget plan, if spread evenly, would significantly cut NASA's budget, forcing the deepest cuts to the space program since just after we landed on the Moon.\n\nEven in today's tight fiscal environment, the Administration has proposed a NASA budget for FY 2013 that spares the agency from such cuts and yet will deliver more than ever from this essential driver of American innovation.\n\nThank you for signing this petition and showing interest in our Nation's space program -- an interest key to sustaining support for programs at NASA and one we could not share more strongly. We encourage you to continue demanding more from our most creative science and technology agencies, and to appreciate that it is not just about how many dollars are spent on such lofty missions, but how effectively that money is spent to deliver results for the American people.

The point you bring up is an extremely good one, and absolutely must he addressed in a very clear way for people to have faith in this sort of system, but fortunately that work was done by those who went before us. \n\nNow, I'm not a political science if civics expert so I don't claim to know what all of the solutions which have been tried are, not which were more successful. I can say that the one system I know of for publicly funded elections involves a sort of primary system but not (as primaries would also have to be publicly funded else the bribery would just happen there). It essentially is that (to use a small example of a gubernatorial race) a candidate would have to prove that they have a significant amount of support in whatever jurisdiction they are running (in my example a state) to justify getting public monies. So for example there is an election to be held in North Dakota for governor and there are 15 people who wish to run. These people, by whatever deadline happens to be chosen, would be required to gather 5% of the voting populations signatures (% can be adjusted however the citizens choose) from each district in the jurisdiction, in this case 5% from each county in ND. Now that is the voting population, so it is 5% of the total number of voters in the previous governors election (even if there are 5 million citizens but only 500,000 voted, they would only need 25,000 signatures). This demonstrates that there is enough citizen support for that person to be a serious candidate without setting the bar so high that only the major parties can clear it. \n\nNow that works in state and local elections, because the total number of signatures and amount if ground is limited so no huge sum if money must be spent to gather the signatures. But it wouldn't work for presidential elections because it would still cost many 10's of millions to get that many signatures from every state in the nation. So on that I don't know specifically what a national system may look like, I do know they exist in most countries but I haven't read enough to know the details.

That's also helped by the fact we don't adhere to a strict calendar of elections either - overall it's a *much* calmer process.\n\nRight now there are plans for all parties to be funded by the taxpayer based on previous election results, so a new party only needs to be \"seed funded\" in essence - if it's popular, it will get public money.
